Ted Zaremba,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Am I the only one that gets an email in the morning stating that my package is out for delivery, then two hours later I get another email stating I won't get my package for another 2-3 days??? This has happened 3 times in the past two weeks. It's bad enough that Amazon seems to have become a dumping ground for companies to get rid of their defective and inferior products but now their delivery and customer service is headed down the drain also."
Na Tasha,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A delivery driver chipped our tiled step. I reported it with photos and CCTV, but Amazon refused to take responsibility. Disappointed that a customer‚Äôs evidence is dismissed, while a driver‚Äôs denial is enough to close a case. Not about money - just wanted things put right."
Cristina Grigore,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Wow. I never knew Amazon has the worst feedback possible.Right, my experience with them today was disgusting. They lost my ¬£200 parcel and they are asking me to go to the police. These people are loosing your money, your items a d then they give you more head ache by asking you to go to the police.  AMAZON, YOU SHOULD REPORT YOURSELF TO THE POLICE."

Candice Richards,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give them zero star I would. I ordered an item to be delivered to Zagreb, Croatia. They gave a date of arrival, I stayed home from work, on day of arrival- they sent ""failed delivery"" - no one rang my buzzer, no one called me. When I followed up with support of the company who contacted me locally, they said no one came to the address, it failed because they do not have an address. What do you mean? When all communication has my address, I cannot make an order without an address. It's 5 days later, item still not received, customer support of local company says it's still for dispatching, they cannot give a date yet. So item was not even ready for deliver then? Pathetic and disappointing! I can't believe this is Amazon. Ow and the help or support chat button on Amazon customer support keeps giving an error message so you cannot contact them, superb!

Lisa Weldon Payton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had to call Amazon Customer Service Corporate because I‚Äôve been dealing with a selfish, stubborn and greedy Amazon Seller! I bought a t-shirt for my oldest son with a picture of his dog my fur baby grandson! I didn‚Äôt realize I hit expedited shipping because it was $90 for that. I looked up and my account has been debited for $135. I have spoken to numerous CSRs from Amazon including Sounak from India who was the best CSR I‚Äôve ever dealt with! He emailed the seller telling him I wanted my full refund only for the seller to offer me the $90 as if he couldn‚Äôt hear me! I then spoke to a couple of more Amazon CSRs since I ordered the shirt June 5, 2025! It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs an imbecile like Trump! Their orders‚Äô are never on time either, but yesterday I called Corporate to tell them I was tired of the seller Poppop Store out of Detroit, Michigan. I was born in Detroit, and spent my summers‚Äô there too! I don‚Äôt understand why he was so selfish, and greedy when he knows how being a Seller Works on Amazon! Their A to Z claim is a bunch of horseshit, because it doesn‚Äôt protect it‚Äôs customers‚Äô but it protects the sellers even though it is supposed to guarantee the buyer their refund in a timely manner, which it doesn‚Äôt! They give the Seller 48 hours to respond to the buyer which is Unfair because the Buyer is already in distress about the product, or service that they‚Äôre calling about! I would stop shopping at Amazon if it Prime didn‚Äôt cost me a little of nothing because I receive commodities from the Government! I shopped EBay long before Amazon, and they make you wait for a certain amount of time before refunding you, but I feel Amazon is Global and should look out for their customers‚Äô better than they do! I‚Äôm so done with Amazon if they can‚Äôt get the man Poppop store to give me my whole refund! I will gladly return the product if that‚Äôs what he wants! Even after I called Amazon Corporate yesterday he only sent $90 plus taxes! I want all my money back, and I called Amazon this morning to tell Cleo the CSR to tell him I‚Äôm ill, and my youngest son was the victim of a violent crime Jan 31, 2025 which was my granddaughter‚Äôs thirteenth birthday! He was shot four times, and lost his left kidney, his spleen, a piece of his pancreas, and UAB Trauma Hospital took the last bullet out of his back nine Thursdays ago! So, I don‚Äôt need the drama! Where is his compassion for other people? I don‚Äôt think Amazon has compassion, nor Empathy either! The proof is in the pudding! Shop at your Own Risküíôüî•üíôüî•"
J A Richards,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon sent me a faulty appliance. It took me 20 mins to navigate my way through their recorded messages and AI to get to speak with a human being who was able to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô, then another 50mins with that person arranging a return.I was disgusted to find that Amazon do not do replacements, so I would have to return, wait (up to 14days!) for a refund and then order another.As I am physically unable to carry the bulky item to my nearest participating post office (4 miles away!) I have been promised that Amazon will pick up the faulty appliance from my home but they could not give me a definite day.This is absolutely unacceptable and I will never buy from Amazon again.I doubt that this will be the end of my problems with Amazon.‚Äòcustomer-centric company‚Äô? Nonsense! Worse still! I spoke with Amazon again today (17th) and was told that they had not arranged a collection, they lied to me! Now I am on hold awaiting another Amazon representative to arrange another collection‚Ä¶ "
Bailey Vallot,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Prime is a rip off. You order items that should be received sooner because of the monthly membership you pay for prime and don't receive your order on time. 
Gus T,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On June 12, 2025, I placed an order through Amazon with a guaranteed delivery date of June 16, 2025. That commitment was broken‚Äînot due to weather, delays, or logistics, but because the delivery driver ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt locate‚Äù the clearly marked main entrance and refused to complete the delivery.I immediately brought this to Amazon‚Äôs attention, expecting them to uphold the level of service they promise millions of customers every day. Their response? A mere $5.00 concession for a failed delivery, wasted time, and outright refusal to fulfill the order‚Äîdespite the fact that the address was accurate and accessible.Let this be a message to Amazon and a warning to the public: when a trillion-dollar corporation treats customer service as a checkbox and compensates failure with pocket change, it exposes a disturbing truth‚Äîprofit comes before people.If Amazon cannot deliver what it promises‚Äîand chooses to minimize the impact on loyal customers‚Äîthen it‚Äôs time consumers take their business elsewhere. We deserve better than indifference."
Chris Barghout,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Always late though I have Amazon prime.   Holidays and weather I am understanding but I live in a suburb of over 200,000 and in a fairly densely populated area.   Of course I can choose not to use Amazon but they have put out of business shops locally where now I am forced to buy from them.

John Hayes,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Jayson Carl assisted me and he was able to set in motion the preffered resolution. I ordered what turned out to be a ""unreturnable BrushCutter, Weed wacker."" It trurns out that this product is from China. parts missing, instructions unclear, no company contact. There was QR code that took you to nowhere. Complete scam! but Jason, from Amazon, made it right. Never purchase anything from HZKJservice. Chinese nightmare!"

sandra,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Have Amazon changed their policy on deliveries ? We were due a delivery earlier today and looked out of the window in time to see the driver dumping the parcel by our rubbish bins . Hubby went out to speak to him and he reluctantly picked up the item and handed it to hubby and then shot off before we could check said parcel which was slightly damaged but nothing major . Kindly ask your delivery drivers to at least have the decency to knock the door first
Preity,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon service has gone to the dogs. Customer service is pathetic. Purchased an item on Amazon 2 weeks ago. Item has still not been delivered. Sad thing is that the delivery was to be fulfilled by Amazon itself. First time the item never even arrived, deliver man put a fake update that the recipient rejected the item. How can it be rejected if it wasn‚Äôt even delivered? Second time I ordered it, it has still not come. Amazon is refusing to provide a refund. Absolutely shameful, disgusting on behalf of Amazon. Pls do not purchase anything from these thugs. Do it at your own peril. It‚Äôs like a gamble with them."

OLD GRUMPY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Good job, I am retired, and I can spend all day trying to create an account. After spending ¬£900 on a new computer, I still can't create an Amazon account. The email address doesn't work. After it's been working for 20 years Telephone number somebody else has already got that one. Can't create an account. Lots of lovely things to buy, tantalising, but unable to create an account You send many emails to me With Interesting Offers. My basket was full, but unable to create an account. Waste of a good days Daylight Sat in front of my computer, so I've given up. I'm gonna pop along to Costco. M&S and all the other discount stores. And put the computer in the skip. PS Bought a new smartphone. No instructions about how to use it. Keep getting missed calls, I recognised the number. It was the wife's, now she's been dead 15 years, not only that, I didn't put her phone in her coffin, bloody smart. These smartphones are for sale to a clairvoyant, cheap and cheerful. Modern technology and I don't mix for now, I'm heading for a psychiatric ward. Doing more research about Amazon 1-star Reviews, and they don't reply to anything. Perhaps I am the lucky one. Forget trying to Buy anything From Amazon."
Paul H,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had spent a great deal of time researching the right steam mop that would help the carer of a vulnerable relative and placed my order on Amazon on the 1 May. The delivery date wasn't clear so a couple of weeks in to my order I called up Amazon and asked them to confirm a delivery date or else I would have to cancel and order urgently elsewhere. The person at Amazon I spoke to assured me that I need not cancel and to hold on as she stated the delivery date would be June 15. Based on trust I waited. I decided to call up two days ago as the orders page now stated it would arrive not on June 15 but much later in Novemeber! No one from Amazon let me know that. When I called them up asking if that was an error on their page they told me,  I wouldn't get the mop sooner. Not happy at all with this!! When I asked to escalete they told me I couldn't as I was speaking to the overall manager. However when I emailed them I was told by someone there that they had escalated the issue stating they would take the expereince I had and learn lessons, not  that they would try to make it right or offer a reasonable remedy.....very unhappy with all this!!!!!"
Christine Anderson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a lot of items from the Morrison's Amazon shopping website in case people haven't used it. It's where you use Amazon to buy your shopping from Morrisons and they deliver when my shopping arrived. It was in several bags that were damaged. The bags had been damaged because the shopping was late the ice blocks most of them had melted leaking whatever is in them all over the food and the bags most of the food was defrosted which means cannot be refrozen again and some of the food that had been placed between ice blocks had frozen. This food was not meant to be frozen in the first place. Big bottles had been put on top of bread which squashed it so basically most of the showroom was damaged after complaining to Amazon they asked me to send some pictures. I did this Lou then sent me a message saying there was nothing wrong with any of the food. What had been defrosted just use impossible. Use 5 days worth of shopping in one day and they were not going to refund me for any of it so I had five bags roughly if damaged food which they would not take or accept responsibility for times are hard to start with. You always pay more when shopping with Amazon shopping, but I did this because I thought it would be easier and more convenient at the time. So my shopping cost me twice as much and I still had to go to the store. It's self at the end of it all. Avoid buying your shopping on Amazon. This has got to be the worst experience I've ever had"

Jonathan Ellis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Went to plan an order today. Hard Drive and gift card for my father. Got the confirmation e-mail saying the order was placed. Go to switch back to my second order since they were going to different addresses and was auto logged out with a prompt to verify and change my creds. Wouldnt accept my phone number, so called customer service. They stated that my account had been flagged due to a past data breach, cancelled my order and locked me out. Their excuse.... I ordered a gift card. They provided absolutely zero support for this, refused to accept the order and refused any form of higher solution or even the respect of speaking to someone in charge. I have half a mind to file a financial complaint for auto cancelling the order, not informing me that my data was compromised and not being willing to provide a sufficient conclusion to their mistake. I already know they will see this and simply bypass it and not even attempt to try to find a resolution. I'll wait a day or two before filing my complaint, just to give them a small chance to bring a sufficient resolution up. "
Mel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"By far the absolute worst customer service I've ever interacted with. I've had countless bad experiences. One time, a chat agent told me that she had nothing in her resources about how to help me. I told her to ask a supervisor or someone who would know, and she responded that her supervisor didn't know the answer either. Like what???? I've also had multiple chat agents straight up lie. There's not even a way to report them for this."
Bruce Brown,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've been a prime member for 12 years and before COVID they promised 2 day delivery and they always delivered. We're now in June of 2025 and even when it says the item will arrive in 2 days my last 2 orders the day it was supposed to be delivered I get an email saying my delivery is delayed. I needed it Friday and today is Monday and I'm refusing it. This exact thing happened just 2 weeks prior. Being a prime member isn't what it used to be. I'm changing to a Walmart.Com membership. I get 2 days delivery from them and I'm not even a member. Amazon has changed and not for the better.

L,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon delivery at 10pm at night is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm never notified of deliveries until after 12 noon.

After I contacted customer service again at 10:01 only then was I told It wouldn't arrive until tomorrow! No stupid company your website said the specific time of 5pm and 10pm TONIGHT! NOT TOMORROW!

What a horror way to treat your customers. HORRIBLE... They as everyone else, take absolutely NO RESPONSIBILITY for screwing with people, just to amuse themselves. Orders never arrive... If shipping is from Amazon... NO WAY to TRACK ITEMS... Only on Amazon app and that doesn't give me any updates,or delivery time. "

TJ Machado,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My 2 day delivery was sent to the opposite side of the country, I was told to just 'wait 14 more days' before I could get a replacement. I told them this was unacceptable at which point I was lied to and told that if the item did not arrive by the 11th I could get a refund. On the 12th when asking for my refund I was told the system was down and to come back a day later. Today, the 13th, I was told 'there was nothing we can do' and I would have to wait another 14 days.Customer service lied over and over again. I doubt the fact that I, a customer for over 2 decades, will no longer be doing business with them will do much to their bottom line, but I refuse to deal with a company that lies to me repeatedly."
JANICE COOK,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Amazon started as a good idea, with packages delivered within two days and easy returns. The larger they have become, the less concerned they are with their customers. Deliveries are seldom done within two days, delivery dates are given and not honored. On the date the item is due they send out a notice saying it has been delayed. Their return policy has changed so read the fine print on everything. Often, you will have to pay for return postage. The return window has grown smaller. On top of all this, the reviews you see of products are not legitimate, although Amazon shows them to be on a verified purchase. I believe I have purchased my last item from Amazon."
Laura Mattingley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  8 have direct instructions on my delivery option page, that all parcels must be left at my flat door, as I am a disabled customer.  Yet again this evening, the amazon driver left the parcels where I was not able to get them and they were not at my door.  Yet again, I contacted amazon through the chat function.  Got passed pillar to post..... ended up being passed to 5 different employees who kept repeating themselves and were not actually helping me, before they decided to end the chat upon me telling them that clearly, amazon discriminate against disabled customers.  As a result of this, I have now cancelled my prime membership and will NEVER use amazon again.... EVER!!!!"
MM,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon Management - You would do well to read up on the fall of IBM and why it happened.If you continue to treat your customers with a total lack of respect and feed them lies and BS then they will walk away just as I will when you eventually refund me the money I paid for an item that has not turned up.  I will not return to Amazon - awful company to deal with.

Rainbowfox Green,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,What's going wrong isn't just with Amazon. Fake Reviews are definitely preferred over honest ones by sales companies. Some honest reviews even get removed. Sometimes because people can't keep up with all the details they aren't treated well and then taken off sites even like this one as well. Fake is definitely growing over honesty. I don't expect this review will stay on either.

Customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon customer service is absolute crap now. I'm about to cancel all of my Amazon related services/products. There is no option to just speak with an agent or select an option outside of their highly inadequate options for the number of issues one could possibly have with an order. Absolutely infuriating. I have been going in circles with their stupid website for 15 minutes at least trying to get help. I don't want a call, my phone is broken right now and I'm waiting on a screen replacement I ordered. I'm beyond pissed off with this stupid site. I left feedback with the agent last time I had to 'jump through hoops' to reach an actual person - and it's just worse now. If you're going to make it so a customer's only option is your stupid bot, then MAKE IT BETTER! It should be the best possible bot, or there should be an option to exit it. Their echodot/Alexa is horrible now. It used to work just fine. Then they had to start making a bunch of changes nobody asked for and now it's just annoying. They clearly don't thoroughly test their software before releasing or listen to their cx feedback."

I‚Äôve always relied on Amazon for my purchases, but lately, it seems they‚Äôre working with unreliable and possibly unethical third-party sellers. This experience has seriously damaged my trust in the platform. "
NK,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Gone downhill over the years. They have made it near impossible to get through to their customer service department. If I try the chat option it just keeps sending me in a loop without getting the support/answers I need. This is due to limited options on their system. If I try the call back option it just ends the call. They used to be really good years ago but I have noticed a rapid decline. I simply want to return an item and made a wasted trip to the post office today as the label they have provided doesn‚Äôt work. Absolute joke!!!

Chinno,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely appalling customer service from Amazon UK. This is a perfect example of how large companies deliberately frustrate customers to avoid solving problems.The Timeline:	‚Ä¢	Ordered two items with Prime delivery	‚Ä¢	Both packages delivered to wrong addresses	‚Ä¢	Called customer service - told to ‚Äúwait until June 12th‚Äù	‚Ä¢	Waited as instructed, contacted them on June 12th	‚Ä¢	Now told to wait ANOTHER 72 hoursThe Pattern:This is clearly a deliberate strategy to wear customers down until they give up. Every time I follow their instructions exactly, they move the goalposts and ask me to wait longer. No attempt to actually solve the problem - just endless delays.What I‚Äôm Paying For vs What I Get:	‚Ä¢	Paying for Prime delivery service	‚Ä¢	Packages delivered to wrong addresses	‚Ä¢	Customer service that refuses to help	‚Ä¢	Endless runaround instead of solutionsThe Bigger Issue:This isn‚Äôt just about my packages - it‚Äôs about Amazon‚Äôs systematic approach to avoid responsibility. They know most customers will eventually give up rather than keep fighting. It‚Äôs a calculated business decision to provide poor service because they can get away with it.My Advice:	‚Ä¢	Screenshot everything	‚Ä¢	Document all calls/chats	‚Ä¢	Dispute charges with your credit card company immediately	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt let them wear you down with endless delaysAmazon UK clearly doesn‚Äôt value its customers. The size of the company means they think they can treat people however they want.

Its like shopping with the likes of wish & temu at this point. The customer service is absolutely useless! The most unprofessional amateur hour staff I have ever entertained. My recommendation would be to save your money from this disaster of a company unless you have alot to throw away on useless garbage. No wonder the partnered with morrisons in the UK (the worst supermarket in the UK as rated by every stat there is..why? No other supermarket would want anything to do with them, only the one with the worst reputation ever. You as amazon are at a rating of 1.3‚òÜ thats 0.3‚òÜ as you have to leave 1.So your basically 0 & i for one am so glad..it will be a good day when you are closed down & your bald geek of a manager are done.

Abdullah Khan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have very bad experience with amazon.it. I spent many hours in last five days. I ordered a product on 7th June. It shows 13th for delivery day. After some time of ordered amazon.it changed the delivery day to 16th june. In five days they didn't dispatch yet. When I contacted customer service. They always lied. Then I complained by email and requested to forward this complaint to upper management, but unfortunately not one help. The problem at very beginning was the price. The product price was 399 euros, but amazon deducted 410 euros. After some time Amazon deducted extra 25 euros. I chatted several hours to get that 35 euros. First they made a lot of excuses but I didn't left them. But amazon also tricked that time in sent me 17 euros in amazon balance instead of original payment. I again contacted the to recover my money at the send the also sent as Amazon balance.After that I requested them to please dispatch my order but they were lying and after two days they said that we don't have that product in our warehouse. And said you should wait until we have it in stock. They also told me that you can cancel your order if you don't like. I requested for alternative product but they didn't arrange it at the end they recommend one product worse than this product and was 20 euros expensive. I wasn't agree and they said tomorrow cancel the order. I didn't want to cancel it because I paid from other currency so it had exchange fee and their refund take around one week.Last five days im in contact with them and no satisfactory response.Please help me if some one has good suggestions.Thanks"

Toolking Tools,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been nwith Amazon Prime for 15 years and they have crumbled. It seems there is no limit to how much Amazon want to profit. I recently purchased hearing amplifiers for over ¬£200. On arrival one side was not working. I opened a return , which usually is very fast, however they are now saying that it will be 14 Days for a refund. This is despite asking for a refund to my Amazon account. Customer service just kept repeating it will take 14 Days. I then attemopted to leave a review for the item, and guess what, it has been removed, however it is still listed under a different listing with the same seller, model number etc. This looks like a way of avoiding bad reviews. The new listing has exactlky the same reviews as the item i purchased. I refuse to carry on paying foir such an atrocious service."

They refused and told me to return it at my own cost.

Lance Sheridan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am cancelling my Amazon account after 10 years of declining customer service. The straw to break the proverbial camel‚Äôs back is a recent book order placed with them. They clearly showed the order total (paid-in-full with a debit gift card); after the order was placed, they decided to split the order, thus charging part of it to my credit card. After spending 30 minutes on the phone with an Amazon customer service supervisor, they refused to correct the issue (changing their policies several times during the conversation). Bottom line: they wouldn‚Äôt budge an inch. Adios."
AA,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, I went through the website to contact Amazon, which gave me 2 options. One was a live chat, the other was a callback. I opted for the chat which came up with an error and it said I should opt for the call back, which I did. This also came up with an error and then gave me the option to call your customer service centre. Customer service is a bit of a stretch. Unfortunately, when you decide to save money by putting your call centre in what I can only assume is India, you end up giving terrible customer service and we can't understand the heavy accents. The person on the phone was trying to tell me what was in the bag which was in front of me, and he was wrong, yet he kept insisting he was correct. Unless he packed the bag himself, or was psychic, how would he?!? Basically, absolutely terrible service. Now I do not have the product I ordered, nor do I have the money and I have to wait for you to investigate for 48 hours.  Terrible service, and you would think that one of the richest companies in the world would be better at delivering items. "

Lu√≠s Cardoso,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Order No. 404-2572417-8110741 - Amazon ESI purchased a La Roche-Posay Anthelios Oil Correct SPF 50+ sunscreen from Amazon, a product I‚Äôve been using for quite some time. As soon as I received it, I found the texture extremely runny, the color different, and it lacked the usual mattifying effect. I assumed it was a new formula from the brand ‚Äî which does happen ‚Äî and continued using it.However, after finishing that bottle, I bought the same product again, this time directly from a pharmacy. The difference is striking: color, texture, scent, skin feel, and the expected mattifying effect ‚Äî everything was back to what I was used to. I then decided to compare the packaging: the product from Amazon is clearly counterfeit.Among several inconsistencies are:- The Amazon label says ‚Äú50 spf‚Äù instead of ‚Äú50+ spf‚Äù;- The color and size of the orange rectangle are different;- There is no batch number or expiration date printed on the packaging;- The font, printing, and finish differ from the original.The most serious part? The product was shipped directly by Amazon itself, not by a third-party seller.To make matters worse, when I tried to leave a negative review warning about the counterfeit product, Amazon censored my comment, claiming it violated their guidelines. In other words, they sell fake products, shipped by themselves, and hide legitimate customer reviews that warn other consumers.It is deeply concerning and unacceptable that a company the size of Amazon would be complicit in the distribution of counterfeit products, ignoring the real risks this poses to public health. This is not just a matter of a bad shopping experience, but one of responsibility and trust ‚Äî fundamental pillars of a platform of this scale."

Lynn,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Lately we've had better success with having items arrive close-to or being on time, so I decided to order some items for overnight delivery, free with Prime if ordering over $25 worth of merchandise. So, I placed the order (> $35), expecting delivery between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. as indicated. However, once the order was complete (""PAID""), the estimated ship date showed up as an entire day later! Not just later on the next day, but the day after that!  I contacted chat to report the issue (but also to report a couple of other problems with orders, too) and the agent gave some lame scripted response about letting the 'concerned team' know. That really feels like bait and switch. Given the advanced state of technology these days, you would think a huge company like that would be able to monitor which items can actually be shipped overnight and which ones cannot.  That, however, is not the only disappointment with vastly under-estimated delivery times! I had ordered a gift for family in another state and have noticed that delivery times to locations outside our area tend to run a bit late, but this most recent under-estimation is ridiculous... about 4 whole days later than stated!

She tells me oh give it til the 9th and on the 10th if it hasn't shown up we can do a refund. I ask her why would the website tell me I can request a refund if it isn't possible? She says sometimes their stuff doesnt update. Beyond frustrated at how long I have had to wait and no resolution from customer service. I used to love Amazon, not sure what has changed with them. I did call back an hour later and spoke with a guy, he told me he was able to process a refund, I am interested to see if I actually receive it!"

Firecrest,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered some  items scheduled to be delivered on Tuesday, tracking showed they were out for delivery on Tuesday morning but they never arrived however the tracking said a delivery had been attempted - which it had not. Later the tracking showed that they were returned to the distribution centre.  The same thing happened on Wednesday. On Thursday they were out for delivery again but returned to the distribution centre 30 minutes later. On Friday they were out for delivery but returned to the distribution centre 2 minutes later. I have had on-line chats withe the customer service staff on two occasions (once I can get past the completely useless chat bot). The staff are very polite but they rush to offer a refund and vouchers rather than actually try and solve the problem. They offered to give me a refund and I could keep the items but made no effort to try and resolve the issue so I would actually receive them. They offered to credit my account with ¬£5 in compensation but appeared not to understand that a credit was no use if they could not deliver anything to my address. However, they did allegedly escalate the issue This morning (Saturday) the items were out for delivery again with a time slot., later a message they were still on their way, then on there way but running late. But nothing.I fail to understand why my package has been ""out for delivery"" five times and not arrive. Surely their systems should identify there is an issue and get a human at the distribution centre to intervene and sort it.Very disappointing and frustrating."
Will Mac,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon clearly employs drivers who either cannot or simply do not read delivery instructions. Our delivery notes specifically state that the front door of the property is not in use and that all deliveries should be made to the rear entrance. Additionally, a large printed sign at eye level reinforces this message.Despite these clear instructions, the driver left the package at the front of the property‚Äîon a main street‚Äîwhere it was subsequently stolen. This not only demonstrates a failure to follow basic directions but also shows a lack of common sense and concern for customer property. Leaving a parcel on a public pavement is obviously not a secure or appropriate place.This experience was the final straw. I will not be using Amazon again."

I am really angry I pay every month to have things delivered next day. Recently never happened. The delivery men do not do their job in the right way. they leave packages anywhere on the street nearly, never do extra miles to find the address. they just want to get rid off the package. Awful service I don‚Äôt recommend to anyone. This was the last order and when sorted I am leaving them and will do not order anything!!!!"
John H,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon wants you to think their delivery service is good. Claiming same day and next day delivery. I have to say they are wrong over 90% of the time. Same day is a joke and will not happen and next day is three days to a week. Customer Service is also a joke. Rude and incomplete people who will not give you a direct answer. This company has got to the dogs and deserves nothing but condemnation.

I'm disabled and live rurally and collection would be complicated so this can't work for me. There is no other way to return the item.Someone has to be present to hand over the item so it would mean waiting by a gate at the end of a track all day... I feel completely betrayed and scammed...

Christine,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This is the second time I have noticed Amazon charged me for Amazon Video. First time I realized I was being charged for over a year. I had Amazon Prime on which they were included. But I did get a refund for that year for over charging. Now they started doing it again. I cancelled my Amazon Prime which takes affect in a few weeks. I contacted Amazon about the charge for Amazon Video. They gave me so many different excuses. First I was told Amazon video was used in my home and was billed to my old bank card that was cancelled so they used card on file. I live alone and no one has my new card. Then after numerous times requesting a supervisor finally talked to one that said someone had my bank card and was using it on a different Amazon account but don't know who. This is so much bs. I decided I want nothing to do with Amazon. Plus I had Amazon Prime no dam such thing as same day or next day delivery. When I purchase things saying it would be delivered same or next day I get every excuse that it has been delayed. No more it's just a waste of money. 
Tami M Scott,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"What has happened to this company!? There was a day when if all else failed use Amazon to get it delivered! It's not that way now, your lucky to get your orders when due, especially when you are a member! As a member I very seldom get my delivery next day let alone same day. I now have to pay 2.99 to get it same day or next day. I thought that is what memberships where paid for! I never get my delivery when it gives me a window of time. Now they don't even give a window they just say ""it's still out for delivery"" wtf! They have me waiting all day long till 9p for deliveries if I want to make sure my item is not stolen. They are now using one of the most incompetent delivery companies in the United States, USPS! Although as of lately UPS and FedEx are just as messed up half the time you don't get notification it's just dumped on your doorstep if you're lucky! Please tell me how do these companies make money if they have to be replacing these packages that don't get delivered? Is that how they make their money? Because what one lady said is very true they try to tell you if your order is not been delivered there's nothing you can do for a refund which is against the law people understand that! I often went to Amazon to buy anything I needed I have recently started going over to eBay because at least I get a guaranteed delivery window something I can't get on Amazon anymore!"
Terez,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to share with Trustpilot the letter I sent to the Amazon Executive Relations Team on June 06, 2025. This has been an ongoing problem for a year with no resolution:Subject: Urgent: Continued Trespassing by AmazonDear Amazon Executive Relations,I am writing with great frustration and urgency. For over a year now, your delivery drivers have repeatedly trespassed on my residential property, parking their large Amazon vans in my private driveway to deliver packages‚Äînot only to me, but also to my neighbors. Despite clear notes in my Amazon account, a large written notice on my front door, and even a verbal warning from a city ordinance officer, your drivers continue to ignore all instructions.Let me be clear:Amazon does not have the legal right to use private residential driveways for deliveries.Other delivery services‚ÄîUPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL‚Äîmanage to deliver to this neighborhood while respecting property boundaries by parking in the street.Your drivers are not only trespassing, they are often blocking access to my home, throwing packages on the ground, and creating physical and emotional stress in my life as a disabled widow and cancer patient.I have previously been told by your Incident Response Team that I could request deliveries via UPS or USPS. I am formally demanding that this be implemented immediately for my address.It is not acceptable for your drivers to treat me and my home with this level of disregard. This is harassment. I want:A direct and individualized response from both your Incident Response Team and Field Quality Assurance Team.Written confirmation that my address has been flagged to prohibit driveway entry.Reassignment of all my deliveries to UPS or USPS permanently.A remedy for the ongoing intrusion even when I am not the recipient‚ÄîAmazon has no right to use my driveway to deliver to my neighbors.This has gone on long enough.

Marc F,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I live in the UK and have on the odd occasion purchased from Amazon US as they calculate the taxes etc for you and to be fair have never had any real issues until recently and today.I purchased a collectible item which was not cheap, only purchasing it because I couldn't get it in the UK. Unfortunately it was shipped in a paper bag with absolutely no protection whatsoever. I used the chat to speak to one of their customer service agents and explained that basically the item was crushed and of no use. in fairness the agent consulted with their supervisor and came back to say that as a one time exception, they would send me a full refund and there would be no need to return the item.This was provided on the transcript of the chat which I always copy as proof (by the way, if you ever need to revisit any of your chat transcripts there is not an option available to do so, however, if you initiate a new chat, then scroll upwards, its all still there from last time). given the above, I disposed of the item as it was too badly broken and didn't want to risk re-ordering.5 days later, no refund. When contacting them to ask why, I was continuously told that the agent had made a ""false promise"" and would be re-coached to correct their mistake and that unless I returned the item there would be no refund!!!!literally after 4 plus hours of chat and phone calls to what was at least 15 agents and supervisors who each kept asking me to repeat why I was contacting them (remember the transcript was all there, and very very long now), they would not acknowledge that I acted on their instructions and was unable to return a disposed of item. There was absolutely no empathy, even to the point of cutting me off mid chat when I had gotten to the point of basically asking ""please just let me speak to a senior person!"". I even asked how I could complain and was told repeatedly that there was no way of doing this and to be fair, if you look on their site, its literally true.Only after asking for their legal department details and adding that I would be contacting my bank to raise a claim and saying that I would share the impact of this with the press etc did one agent eventually give in and agreed to what was their original suggestion and instruction.with exception of a few, overall what a complete bunch of rude and unsympathetic people they were, even telling me that yes, regardless of the circumstances (their fault) I just had to accept that I'd lost my money. 100% in need of training in their customer relations department."

Jane,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon delivery service is incredibly bad. I have bought several different items from Amazon BECAUSE the delivery was supposed to be within 2-days, just to have it delayed by typically a week if not longer. The best part is that these were parts I ordered to get my car up and running before my next scheduled shift at work. I used to check Amazon first for almost everything I bought. Since the start of this year, we had Amazon delivery forced on us instead of USPS and I have almost completely stopped using Amazon because they are so bad. We still have Prime for TV, but I go out of my way to pay more through other vendors just to avoid Amazon now. If they go back to letting others deliver, or if they manage to be transparent about expected delivery times rather than falsely claiming 2-day shipping, I may go back to burning money on their website again."

Kenny Killian,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am boycotting Amazon and I HIGHLY encourage everyone else to do the same and I'll be more than happy to tell y'all why..... I'm a former truck driver, (no, I never drove for Amazon) and I'm subscribed to a couple of trucker channels on YouTube, one of which is Bonehead Truckers, (great channel) and from watching and contributing to that channel, I've learned some very valuable information regarding Amazon..... Most if not all of the Amazon truck drivers, (and I'm talking the 18-wheeler big rigs), do NOT understand a word of English! That's right, Amazon hires drivers from other countries, mostly from the Middle East who can't read, write, speak or understand English at ALL! Also, these truckers from other countries carry non-domicile CDLs. A non-domicile CDL means that their CDL is only good in THEIR home country, such as Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, etc and it's NOT good in the USA..... How is that legal?Well, we can thank the former Obama administration for that and it's been going on ever since then, but finally, the Trump administration is doing something about it! Now, why should that be a problem? Because if you can't understand English, then how are you going to understand road signs in the USA that are in English? You can't! And because of this, a LOT of accidents have occurred on US roads, highways and interstates where a non-English speaking Amazon truck driver has plowed into multiple vehicles, resulting in very tragic accidents and ending people's times on Earth. Now, think about it..... Every time you or someone else orders something from Amazon, you could very well be putting people's lives at risk on the road, because chances are, your package is on a 53' trailer, on its way to the next Amazon warehouse, being pulled by a driver who can't understand English. Also, for those of you wonder why your Amazon packages are late, that's probably why..... Let that sink in."

ibrahim Halil Cubuk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I placed an order for my uncle's birthday, and it said it would arrive on Saturday, a week passed and it's the second Saturday and there's still no shipment, I wrote to Amazon customer service and customer service says deal with the customer, not us, why are you making me deal with people, you should solve the problems, not me"
Consumer,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,It took Amazon two months to provide a replacement computer when mine stopped working whilst within warranty.They wouldn't deal with me directly because I hadn't ordered the original. It was ordered on my behalf as I didn't have a device to make said order on. Amazon fobbed that person off repeatedly for two months. Not acceptable. I ended up buying another computer. So I now have two and am out of pocket.Prior to this I had always found Amazon's customer service to be bery good. But I will now avoid shopping with them for anything. Not that they'll care. They're not exactly struggling.

J C,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Returns hell. An electrical appliance broke after a month. I wasn't able to return it because it was past the 30-day returns (even for faulty products!) so I had to contact the seller directly... in China. It took me 40-minutes to workout how to talk to a human, having been sent in loops again and again."
j.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Where to begin? I love that Amazon has low prices and, as long as a consumer does their due diligence with comparing prices with other retailers and marketplaces, the site offers some really great deals.That said...1. They don't tell the customer that there's going to be a delay until they've allowed the order to go into ship status. They should give the customer the right to cancel the order if they're not happy about the new date.2. The customer service is atrocious. Last weekend, I was lied to by multiple customer service reps via chat, escalated to a manager, and only then, after hours of lost time, received any solution that showed that my time and money are valued.3. Protection of products in packages is hit or miss. It's so bad that I actually become anxious sometimes when it's something I care about receiving unbroken. Today, I received an essential oil product that had a broken glass dropper. Not only did the manufacturer not have the product appropriately safeguarded inside the product packaging, but Amazon also didn't even use bubble wrap to keep it safe.4. Amazon never allows customers to provide reviews on the website about customer service or deliveries. Every other business out there is judged based on all aspects of service, but somehow Amazon has gotten around this arrangement. What do I mean? Try to find a valid account on Google that pops up so that customers can leave reviews. I'm glad TrustPilot at least offers this option.5. Lastly, Amazon also has a nasty habit of holding up funds if there's a price change between the moment the customer orders and the package ships. So, yesterday, I ordered X amount of product and that placed a pending authorization on my bank account. Okay. Fine. Last night, a price changed happened. Instead of dropping the original authorization or processing a refund for the 4 CENTS difference, Amazon placed a second hold on the account for the total minus the pennies. So, now I'm waiting to see if I'm going to get double billed and whether I'm going to have to file a dispute, which means losing more time and money."

Liam Edward O'Hara,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My experience with Amazon has been beyond unacceptable. After sending multiple emails ‚Äî including to Executive Customer Services and even Jeff Bezos's email ‚Äî I‚Äôve been met with complete silence. As a loyal customer for years, this has left me feeling dismissed, stressed, and deeply disrespected.Amazon wrongly cancelled one of my orders, then admitted the error ‚Äî only for the item to become unavailable. When I followed up to express my frustration, I was stunned to receive a cold and threatening email accusing me of refund abuse, referencing past orders with genuine issues:A gift item (brandy) arrived damaged and poorly packaged ‚Äî not suitable for gifting.A bike pump was marked as delivered but was left outside the building and never reached me.Cat food biscuits were delivered with torn packaging and no protection.A cat food subscription order was dispatched despite cancellation.These issues occurred over a six-month period and were never previously flagged ‚Äî until now, when I complained. It feels like Amazon made a mistake, and instead of owning it, they retaliated by digging up unrelated returns to justify threats of account closure and forfeiture of my ¬£122 gift card balance.To make matters worse, they requested personal photographic evidence of me ‚Äî with no explanation. That request alone was distressing and invasive, making me feel criminalised over entirely valid concerns. Anyone could be using this photo and why did they want it. To be treated like a criminal has left me angry and stressed beyond words which amazon don't care about. I still want to know why they're collecting photographic identity information. I‚Äôve followed Amazon‚Äôs policies. I‚Äôve been transparent. I‚Äôve reported genuine issues ‚Äî and instead of empathy or support, I‚Äôve received threats and silence. There has been no meaningful response, no apology, and no accountability.They even implied I wouldn‚Äôt be able to return future faulty products ‚Äî a disturbing suggestion that adds more anxiety about using my account, especially with a significant gift card balance still there. I feel completely unsupported and frankly scared to use my account now.It‚Äôs appalling that a company of this size has no independent complaints process. Customer service offers no real help ‚Äî just empty handovers and more frustration. I‚Äôm now seriously considering small claims court and will be sending amazon a letter before action. This entire experience has deeply damaged my trust in Amazon. I never expected to be treated this way by a company I once relied on. "
Ralf Witte,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The order and delivery basically went well. However, Amazon claimed that the payment had not worked. In the end, I paid with a different credit card, the other item had supposedly been canceled beforehand, but this was not true. I received two parts twice. As these were reliably delivered abroad with Globalbox, it is difficult to return them. And the customer service is a disaster, as is the availability. I regret not having bought these two items directly from the retailer! After a completely pointless chat with rather incompetent people, I was promised a clarification of the case. So far, nothing has happened! Because you have to do research, even though you received all my information long ago. ‚ÄûThe store‚Äú has passed its zenith!"

The order was set to be picked up at a Whole Foods Amazon Counter in Aventura, Florida, by a designated recipient (gift order).Shortly after placing the order and completing payment with my Wise (EU) card, Amazon abruptly closed my account without any warning, explanation, or reason. The items were never delivered, and no refund was issued.I assumed the money would return automatically to my card ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt. I filed a chargeback with Wise, and instead of supporting me, Wise blocked my account entirely. Now I have no access to the funds and no support from either Amazon or Wise.I've contacted both parties multiple times ‚Äî zero result. It‚Äôs been over 6 weeks, and I still have no product, no refund, and no access to my payment account.This feels like daylight robbery. Amazon kept the money without fulfilling the order, and when I tried to protect my funds, the payment platform froze me out.I'm now filing official complaints with regulators (FTC, EU authorities).Avoid Amazon if you value transparency and customer protection."

Tinbit Daniel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon Prime member for years, but my recent delivery experience was disappointing. The delivery person had trouble accessing my building, and when I politely asked how others usually handle this, I received a rude and unprofessional response.I initially thought my package had been delivered, but it was actually returned without any attempt to contact me or complete the delivery. I did not reject the package ‚Äî the return was caused by the courier‚Äôs actions.I was told the refund would only be processed once the item is back in stock. This delay is frustrating because the situation was not my fault, yet I am being held accountable for it.As a Prime member who has already waited several days, I expect better service, faster resolution, and more professional communication from delivery personnel. I hope Amazon improves its delivery process and customer support to prevent others from facing similar issues."
Robert Kan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We previously used Amazon Marketplace to purchase items for our company sites. However, we have since discontinued using the platform due to ongoing issues with invoicing and payment reconciliation.A major concern was the inability to receive a single consolidated invoice for purchases. Items were frequently split across multiple invoices by various third-party suppliers, making the reconciliation of our credit card statements unnecessarily time-consuming and frustrating.Additionally, we noticed discrepancies between the prices quoted at checkout and the actual charges on our credit card. In several instances, suppliers added unexpected costs after the purchase was completed.Attempts to contact Amazon to address these concerns proved extremely difficult, with limited options for direct support or clear resolution."

Laurie in Idaho ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"For a company that could do so much better with the reach that they have, that reach is very disappointing. I have to say that customer service for this business is beyond helpless. I‚Äôm gonna speak to my one experience that I had just recently although I‚Äôve had a lot of -ones, This one really pissed me off. I was trying to send an order to a sick loved one that lives in a very hot part of the country. I placed the order on Memorial Day. The order was supposed to be there on the 27th. However, that did not happen. I noticed that Amazon likes to split these orders up, for why I don‚Äôt know, but to me an order unless it‚Äôs from a different seller, I understand that, but this was not from a different seller. Two of the items shipped, got to this individual on the day that it was supposed to get there. The other item was cough syrup. Now when you buy cough syrup on any site they make you put your ID in and all this other information. Which I did. I was gonna be paying over 20+ dollars for this cough syrup with a delivery fee another delivery fee because it didn‚Äôt deliver with the other items when I noticed that it didn‚Äôt ship and I needed it there. I tried to cancel it. It hadn‚Äôt shipped they said they couldn‚Äôt cancel the order. Then I get these weird emails late Wednesday morning, saying that my money was going to be refunded because the item was gonna be there. OK I tried to cancel this because you hadn‚Äôt shipped it and you told me no that you couldn‚Äôt cancel it but then you turn around after the fact after it should‚Äôve been delivered and you cancel it and then you don‚Äôt even give me the amount of money I spent on an item that you couldn‚Äôt deliver for whatever reason no reason given just that it‚Äôs not gonna get there. I paid $20 for it plus shipping. You didn‚Äôt get it there you didn‚Äôt deliver it and you only give me $9.45. What‚Äôs wrong with this picture Amazon? Am I paying for the owners luxury life or am I paying for bullshit or am I paying for excuses? I‚Äôm paying for a product that you said would get there. You wouldn‚Äôt allow me to cancel it then you turn around after it should‚Äôve showed up and canceled it and didn‚Äôt give me all of my money back. Your scum buckets!"

When I finally got through to an Amazon ""human being"" customer service representative, they demanded that I take a photo of the 4 damaged baking soda boxes before I could get a refund (4 x $.89 = $3.56) on my SNAP EBT card!

Arindima,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The product does what it‚Äôs supposed to, but it didn‚Äôt really stand out. There were a few small issues (like [insert specific detail if needed]), but nothing major. It‚Äôs okay for the price, though I was expecting a bit more in terms of [quality/performance/durability/etc.]. Overall, it‚Äôs usable, just not something I‚Äôd rave about."
Dr Keith Greenfield ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a good customer for many years and had a high opinion of Amazon. I have one had the most awful few days experience involving confusing messages, initially delayed delivery, then promises of next day arrival, then apparent problems with payment, and now cancellation of the order.To add insult, and after hours spent on the web and telephone, a suggestion that I can order again ‚Äúbut the price has increased‚Äù. This is not the impressive customer care I remember."
ExposingLiars,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They killed my mother. She was messed around with so. much by lack of delivery and the lies they kept telling her. After jerking her around for nearly a year while waiting for the driver who left without delivering she had a heart attack from the stress and died. I am going to sue the living shit out of all of them for this.
Joe Todaro,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"*** Watch Out for Sellers Engaging in Deceptive Practices, Like Reselling Returned Items ***Dear Amazon Customer Service: I received the LEVELEVE Multi Position 4 Step Ladder with several dents and clear signs of previous use, which strongly suggests it was a returned item. (See photos attached to my Google review.) I am formally requesting a full refund so I can purchase a new HB Tower ladder instead.It is disappointing that the seller (Yuanchenfram) engaged in such misleading practices. I hope this serves as a lesson for the seller, and I encourage future customers to be vigilant."
N E,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They didn't deliver my Father's birthday gift on May 25. They said that it would be delivered today.I went to track the delivery they wanted me to cancel the order.It wasn't until the customer service rep called them that I found out that the package was not even out for delivery (10:30 am PDT). They got it out for delivery, finally, with an estimated time between 1:15pm and 3:15 pm PDT.Now the time has changed to 2:15-4:15 pm. I called back customer service and all they did was offer empty apologies, saying there was nothing they could do and tell me that they understood my frustration (Liar) but he can't make any phone calls to Airway Heights to find out, what was suppose to be a priority delivery because of their screw ups, was no longer a priority.Amazon wants to brag about how great they are and how they are suppose to be a customer centric company who cares about the customer. I SAY BS. They care nothing about the customer. If you try to get to a customer rep at their site, their system is designed to prevent that. It will send you in a loop, denying you the ability to communicate to a human being.If you call their customer service directly (I Googled the number) their automated system has been programed to attempt to get through to a human being. It takes me over 15 minutes of saying Customer Rep, over and over again while their program tries to send me a link to there website that they have programed specifically to prevent anyone reaching a real person.I hope people read this and try for themselves to reach a live human being at Amazon.com, and they try on the phone, and then start boycotting them. I am convinced that this is retaliation and that they will find someway not to deliver my Father's birthday gift today (this is my personal opinion) because of everything I am doing with these reviews  "

Paul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so as a former seller on Amazon, I feel obligated to put in print my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the means and methods that Amazon uses to perform their work. Nothing, I repeat nothing is straightforward or simple in accomplishing whatever it is you set out to do with Amazon as a seller. The process is so complicated and so demanding and requires such specific input it's virtually impossible to get anything done. And then to have product returned that did not sell that I had regretfully sent to Amazon fulfillment distribution centers oh my God.  I can only imagine that giving birth to a 20 lb infant would be easier than what they require. Then of course you call for help you wait for 40 minutes and you finally connect with someone that speaks English as a foreign language and of course the call is disconnected what a delight. Other than that I have no strong feelings. Rest assured Amazon will never ever get my business again as a buyer or seller and of conversation"
Eva,Rated 3 out of 5 stars," Most of the time I really love amazon, as it has literally everything ,but its when they do stuff like this that drives me nuts.If you search ""white fox"" into amazon, it comes up with some very believable white fox hoodies. But I can tell from multiple factors that these are fake.1.  If this was real, the title would be something like ""White fox hoodie, pink"". But instead it is ""Women's Graphic Hoodies Oversized Hoodie Letter Print....""2.I have seen lots of reviews that say that the fabric is wrong and the lettering is flat and wonky.3.The creator is not white fox in amazon, it is the ""Tompassion store""4.The label does not say white fox.This has happened to many items in amazon  and it is really frustrating if you think you have simply got a bargain, but when it comes it is all wrong.I have even emailed White Fox about this."
True One,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Delivery driver stole my package! She said she delivered it to a safe place? I checked all around my building and it wasn‚Äôt there?

karen njagi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon used to be the Earth's most customer centric company. I loved shopping there. But lately, they can drive you mad or to tears.I placed an order for skincare products that were delivered with spillage. A lot of spillage. I initiated a return. Guess what? I'm supposed to pay 7.99 USD for them to pick up. To make matters worse, after waiting for 10 days, I get a refund for 13 items instead of the returned 15 items. I decide to engage customer care and for two hours i'm transferred from one associate to another. Most of the time the associates can't even type proper English. They don't even want to listen. Clearly they are pressed for time. Some associates will type messages that are clearly intended for a different customer. Eventually, I was escalated to an ""Amazon leadership Team"". This supervisor was so rude and hang up on meüòÆüò≤. She insisted they received 13 items. I have a business account where I spend an average of $2000 per month. And she thinks I was trying to swindle Amazon out of $24. Does it even make sense?"

Pedro Choca,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very frustrating experience.  Bought a pair of compact fluorescent bulbs; neither worked. This company makes it very difficult to return an item.

Kristopher Mccanless,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a specific phone case for a specific phone, paid for it, and Amazon delivered something else. After multiple attempts to get this farce corrected, Amazon finally tells me that not only will I have to go out of my way to return what I didn't order, but I will be charged a ""return fee"" of over half of what they charged me. So, not only will I not receive what I ordered and paid for, I get penalized for the screw up from Amazon. Very dirty, anti-consumer practice. Straight up fraud for anyone else, but Amazon thinks it is normal.   "

Joe H,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has become a scam. First off, have you tried leaving negative reviews? Amazon blocks them. You will get an email saying the review focuses on ""prohibited topics"". These are: ""Sellers, Delivery, Packaging, Pricing, Availability"". So what if your review doesn't focus on these vague topics? It still gets kicked backed under the same vague excuse. This prevents you from warning fellow customers about scams, products that are used being sold as new, and products that are literally not whats advertised. I have been unable to leave a SINGLE negative review in OVER FOUR YEARS! ALL OF THEM GET BLOCKED!And if its a positive review? Accepted immediately.EVEN IF YOU PURPOSELY talk about ""prohibited topics"" ONLY! They also false advertise being able to exchange items. Despite nearly every page reassuring you EXCHANGE or RETURNs accepted, the second you have a problem you are screwed. Its up to a computer and unaccountable people in another country if you can exchange your product. They will force you to go through a lengthy return process despite if you need an exchange. This means if you pay for an item with their partner affirm, you have to go through a whole new loan process, increased interests rates, all sorts of redtape. They may also ask you to submit photos, when its clearly a situation that is their fault. Further detering you from exchanges and lengthening the amount of time to fix their screwups.I bought a very expensive rifle scope from them, SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON. Funny thing is, this rifle scope has been discontinued by the manufacturer for over half a decade. Sure enough, the item I got was marked with a ""New item"" sticker, however what was in it was loose. No original packaging, clearly a used item with wear marks, other peoples batteries, AND missing the much needed IR emitter, which makes the scope useless at night without. I guess I should be greatful they included a crumpled case and batteries for the IR emitter becuase the second one I ordered, didnt even have that much. Did I mention the delivery date was pushed back twice??So I called to exhange. Should be easy. Except as everything with Amazon, they only allow a return. Which, Again, is not whats advertised on their site. I get rude foreign workers, whos entire job is dependent on whether the computer gives them a button to press. If the exchange button is greyed out, they can't do anything. $1000s of dollars, my credit, and interest rates, all at the mercy of whether someone has a button to press.So I order another one. Whole new loan, higher interest rates, while my money is still tied up in the first scam they sent me. Guess what? Got the same thing again. Another $700+ item, just rolling around in a box made to look like a new item. Again missing the IR emittor, making the scope useless. Even the directions say ""IR LIGHT INCLUDED"". This time, amazon wants me to send pictures or they won't do anything.. They send me a link in email... Except they didnt. So I call another useless ""leadership member"". Her response is literally, well the computer shows the email sent so there is NO WAY there could be an issue! Apperantly, leadership has never heard of glitches. They are so dependent on their computers that they literally cannot believe something could ever go wrong. And this is nearly EVERY Amazon order! If you get someone from another country, which is 99.99% of the time, be prepared to repeat yourself, spend hours on the phone, have your life and wallet at the mercy of a computers bidding.So why havent they been sued yet?Well they have! Sort of.If you look at their BBB rating you'll see a GLOWING A+ rating!And right beneath that they have not one, not 2, but 3 ""alerts"".One for being sued by the US government over returns, another for bad behaviour regarding subscription charges, and another over fake sites pretending to be Amazon hiring.So the BBB considers that... an A+ business. Kinda seems like the BBB has been compromised, doesn't it?Oh, you'll also see endless complaints from real customers, but the Better Business Bureau doesn't count those! Of course not! Why would an organization thats for ""Better Businesses"", care about the people who have actually done BUSINESS with the company? Don't forget Amazon was also a company that withheld desperatly needed medical items from the public during Covid. Some A+ Business.So where does that leave us? Well, until Amazon finally pisses off the wrong people at the wrong time and gets some serious class action lawsuits, its gonna get worse before it gets better. We will see the following with zero accountability:- Used items sold and presented as new. - Incomplete items with no recourse.- Lies about returns and exchanges- Manipulated product reviews- Late packages- Terrible customer service A+ BBB rating. Right."

Udayan Shah,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Undelivered Package ‚Äì Prime MemberDear Amazon Customer Service Team,I am writing to formally complain about the unresolved issue regarding my recent order.

At 6:10 AM, the status stated, ""Out for delivery ‚Äì Bothell, US,"" and then at 10:57 AM, it was marked as ""Delivered ‚Äì Bothell, US."" However, I never received the package, and there is no proof of delivery.I contacted customer service, but the representative (Zen) was unable to provide a solution beyond asking me to wait. This response is unacceptable, especially given that it has been over a week since the order was placed. Waiting indefinitely is not a solution, and I need clear answers on where my package is and when I will receive it.As a loyal Prime member, I expect Amazon to resolve this issue promptly. I request:1.	A thorough investigation into the delivery failure and proof of where the package was delivered.2.	Immediate re-shipment or a full refund if the package is confirmed missing.3.	An improvement in customer support to provide clear resolutions rather than vague delays.Please escalate this matter and respond with a concrete solution as soon as possible. I appreciate your prompt attention to this issue.Sincerely,Uday Shah________________________________________"

BB's Banging Boxes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,That‚Äôs 3 separate orders I have placed on Amazon over the pasted 2 weeks that haven‚Äôt turned up. The 3rd order due to be delivered today before 10pm hasn‚Äôt even been dispatched so I went on the app to cancel only for Amazon to refuse it and send me a dispatch email 4 mins later saying my items will arrive tomorrow. Noelle from Customer Service was no help at all! 
Lora Premo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to love Amazon but they have made it impossible to shop there. The number one problem is that they don't show you how much of what you're paying goes towards tariffs which is a significant piece of information we all would like to have. I won't buy anything that has a tariff attached to it and if you're not gonna let me know which items those are I guess I won't buy anything at all from you. Furthermore the fact that Kohl's has now dropped out of the returns process means the only return options I have that are within 50 miles of my house are UPS stores which means the item takes 30 days to generate a refund and I have to turn my life into a spreadsheet full of Amazon returns that I have to track. I will never as long as I live buy anything else from Amazon that has even the slightest possibility of being returned. That means I will try no new products ever again. I'm also going to minimize or completely stop making purchases because I wanna know how much I'm being ripped off by Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos is too busy licking his butt to do that for me.Finally, the last word on this is that you must not use your app when you are deciding what you wanna buy. Go out to the regular website -- put the things in your basket -- THEN login -- then go to your app (or finish the purchase on the website -- either way). Why is this? Because things are more expensive *after you're logged in* but if you put an item in your cart before you login they are forced to give you the lower price. It works best if you are doing it incognito. If they already know who you are from your cookies it's not going to work. These are substantial price differences and this is also highly illegal by the way and Amazon knows it. Different prices for different people is discrimination. "

I contacted Amazon and they said no big deal we will credit your account 69.99 no need to send it back. Naturally, I discarded of the mattress . The money never showed up in my account. Fast forward to today, may 24 , 2025 i contacted a manager who told me the sales associate was wrong and they could not refund the money.  They asked that I pack it up and ship it back and I told them I had already discarded it because telhe issue was resolved.  Long story short, they declined to reimburse me and to make it right they would send 10 dollars to the account. Pathetic excuse for customer service from one of the biggest companies across the globe.

It came in a large wood box that required us to break it apart to get into the product.  There's no way I could ship it back to China.  I asked if nothing else they could offer a little credit so I could hire a professional to repair the crack.  Nope, couldn't do it.  I paid $3000 for this.  So disappointed with Amazon.

Marianne Ward,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I order from Amazon frequently and it is a seamless process.  They outshine WalMart by a million miles when it comes to their website order process and delivery.  Most people only review when there's a problem.  Look at the small # of complaints on this site compared to the volume of business they do.  My only issue is I would like to get text updates on shipments.  I have phoned customer service and there is never a satisfactory solution. Hopefully IT can assist with this in the future.
Rachel Milliken,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,i was told an item had been delivered but it hadn't been so i requested a refund. that was in February and i am still waiting. i keep being told by customer services to wait 5 working days. i have been told the same thing for 3 months and every time they tell me the same thing. it is totally and utterly unacceptable as well as infuriating.

Karianne Newton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I was sold fake professional art supplies by Amazon.com. I spoke with an agent who informed me that after dropping off the item at a UPS for return I would recieve my refund in 3-5 days. After deopping the item off I recieved an email stating it could take a month or more to recieve my refund. This company has turned into a hub for scammers that are so broke they cant afford to instantly provide large refunds after getting caught selling fraudulent products.
Louis Windsor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought a couple of External Hard Drives and I'll use my email to Amazon as the review.  This email was sent 3 times with no acknowledgement nor response each time.I've tried thrice to contact you by email. First time I responded to an email YOU sent my daughter and then twice to the support email address. I got neither an acknowledgement nor a response so I'm trying again....I writing this to register my complete and utter disappointment with my last two orders on US Amazon! I've ordered external hard drives from US Amazon MANY times before and have always paid international delivery fees etc.My daughter(s) have Prime membership(s). My eldest daughter suggested I set myself up as an additional delivery address on her Prime account which I did.I entered an order on the US marketplace as the drives were available there on a special. I noticed that delivery was being charged so immediately requested a callback from support.When this call came I queried with your rep about the delivery charge as I was using my daughter's Prime account and was not expecting to be charged delivery!?Your rep then said ""Just finalize your order and when you receive it phone US Amazon and your delivery charges will be refunded"".I then confirmed with your rep that it would be a ""refund"" and not a ""credit"" and he responded it would be a refund on the same process as my original payment. I also explained I was in Australia ordering on my daughter's Prime account in the US Marketplace.I confirmed that he would put a note on my account (my daughter's account) confirming all this.I then completed the order and put in another (to avoid import duties etc). Since I was expecting both delivery fees to be refunded I was happy with the two (as opposed to ONE) orders.A couple of hours ago ONE package was delivered. That ONE package contained TWO external drives (in the ONE package). I requested a callback from US Amazon to arrange my refunds and, after detailing all my circumstances MANY times, was told I was NOT getting the delivery charges refunded!!!!I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told that it was policy not to refund international delivery charges even on a Prime membership.So, regardless of the promise of free delivery on Prime, AND a promise of refunds from the first rep I was denied said refund(s). The supervisor said, after numerous repeats of my situation, I had been made a ""false promise"" by the first rep :( Fool me, I thought a promise was a promise!? :(  What, exactly, is a ""false"" promise!?Setting aside my disappointment for the moment, I put in another request for a callback. I was transferred and spoke to my fifth rep...I asked, since both orders were delivered in ONE package, shouldn't I get a refund or adjustment on the second delivery charge?I was then told it was a ""delivery AND handling charge"" and both would stand! Surely the ""postage"" component is the major cost in delivery.  The ""postage"" on two items in the same box might be a little more than one item in a box. So the ""delivery and handling"" on 2 items in one box should be a little bit more than 1 item in one box???  So most of the charge for the second delivery should be refunded?Another disappointment from Amazon :( I get better service from Temu I'm sad/glad to say :(I was expecting SO MUCH more from Amazon :( :( :( Sadly, not any more...."

–Æ–ª–∏—è –¢—Ä–∞—è–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon Prime customer for years, but this experience left me disappointed and genuinely frustrated.I returned a pair of sandals that didn‚Äôt fit and requested the refund to be added to my Amazon balance. After several days with no refund, I contacted customer service. Eventually, an agent manually processed the refund and promised me a $30 compensation for the inconvenience, along with a refund for express shipping on my next order ‚Äî sneakers I urgently needed for a trip.Based on this, I placed the sneaker order and paid extra for fast delivery.A few days later, I contacted support again to ask when the compensation would be issued. Shockingly, instead of processing the promised credit, an agent canceled my sneaker order without my consent, refunded the amount, and told me the compensation would not be honored. I never received the sneakers, never got the $30, and wasted hours trying to resolve this.I was even asked to verify my identity with a passport ‚Äî which I did ‚Äî only to be told later that nothing would be done.This situation was not just inconvenient; it was deeply disappointing and unprofessional. No customer should have to go through this much trouble over a broken promise.I have now written a formal complaint and am still waiting for a proper resolution. I sincerely hope Amazon takes this seriously and responds appropriately."

That turned out to be a complete lie.After waiting hours and hearing nothing, I called again, only to be told that delivery wasn‚Äôt possible until tomorrow. Now I have to take a day off work just to receive a package that should‚Äôve arrived today.

Jahari Marsh,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrible they will cheat you. Year before I bought cleaning supplies. The buy $50 get $15 like they have now. Well I did that and got the run around and finally they told me I didn't qualify because my items wasn't shipped together but they was bought together but amazon didn't take the money out of the account at the same time so they treated as individual items. Very scammy of them. I won't be doing that again. Thought I would be saving money but nope. Don't do the stock up and save. Also, delivery is crazy they expect people to pay a extra delivery service for $4.99 a month just to deliver for $35 for free thats not free. Also they make people spend $10-$7 for each delivery and expect to give their drivers with benefits tips. Music subscription cost about $13- and more when I'm a prime member. Talk about milking every service they have because they went overboard so customers have to pay. I think i'm going to cancel my membership because its getting useless and I have to contact customer service a lot. My mothers day gift was $24 giftset I had to return and spent money that they said they would reimburse. After it was damaged the box and couldn't give as a gift because it was open and then they do it again. I don't know if they was being funny or not but not cool. Avoid this place. "

I.e traced the delivery, in an appropriate wait time. Then refunded the item, as where my parcel was left, which  was agreed it was unacceptable. She then proceeded with a refund.

Anony Mous,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon sends a lot of defective goods, and without packaging (label just slapped on item, arrives torn and exposed to the elements),as well as sending previously opened items that other customers had already returned. Amazon fights you every step of the way for any refunds on their defective goods, making you call multiple times, each time getting transferred multiple times, and after over an hour on the phone, they'll hang up on you or refuse, making you start all over again. Ordered a 3-pack of lotion, received an open SINGLE lotion, stuffed in an envelope. A superviser promised a $69 refund, then never refunded it and doesn't keep notes, so a refund is refused by other reps later. On and on; constant problems.The only way to get refunds is through your bank, and dealing with Amazon is infuriating and wastes half of your day.Would give ZERO stars if I could. Terrible company, with horrible customer service, lots of defective items, missing items, and carelessness with, sometimes entirely missing, packaging.Strongly suggest, really, any other company.Amazon exists to sell you cheap, knocked off Chinese clones of stolen American-company IP. Buy directly from the companies. Skip the infuriating mess that is Amazon, junk, and the hours of your life wasted on them, just to get your money back. TRASH. HORRIBLE company."

I leave the house twice a week at 6am for a walk and never leave it apart from that so I'm always in and they never even bother to ring the buzzer from the bottom floor.

Despite taking and sending photos of both sides I was told I had to take a photo of both sides in the same photo which is impossible.  They now don't even bother replying.  I reordered in 2 orders.  1 order arrived but 1 was missing - I think they mixed it up and forgot it was 2 orders.  Now they are stalling on a refund for the missing item.  So I've lost about euro 90.  I'm disgusted at the horrendously poor behaviour of them and the hours of my life I've wasted trying to fix THEIR problem.

So I phoned them straight away to ask questions and for reassurance it wasn't a scam but no the guy when he looked into it he could see the message from his side so it definatly came from them, but today I phoned again to speak to a Manager who couldn't see anything on there system.

Pickup for returns is no longer free. If I want to return it for free you have to take it to UPS and purchase a box to put it in.On top of all that Amazon delivery drivers are not trained at delivering mail like USPS, UPS and FedEx. They're just subcontracted drivers randomly assigned an area for a day and use phone GPS to make deliveries. What can go wrong? Everything. They've delivered my packages to the wrong apartments, wrong building. Or just ditch my package at the front entrance of the building for anyone to walk by and steal. I've watched some of them walking around and around the building unable to find the front entrance. I get some of the drivers are overworked and confused, but a blind person could easily find the front door!This is beyond ridiculous and not worth the hassle. I'm going to start shopping elsewhere that still uses packages and an actual legitimate shipping service."

Sean Harry,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A shockingly poor service. Paying subscription for Amazon Prime means next day delivery on their items, and access to a Netflix style streaming channel. The shows on their channel, aside from Bosch and The Boys, are pretty terrible, so I barley used it. Now they have added commercials to all their shows! However, the worst part is their delivery service; you order an item on Amazon Prime advertised as next day delivery, but it almost always arrives two or three days later. No e-mail or text to update you, and getting hold of customer service is impossible; they try to make you use an AI chatbot! A truly appalling service!"
Marvin McClure,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I initially made and inquiry with customer service about warranty information regarding some items I had purchased. When you are on the order page and want to find out about warranty information they recommend you contact the seller which in many case takes you to another realm of wasteful searches that many times provide now results. I found that by giving the Customer Service Person the order number he was able to bring up all the warranty information I needed. Why isn't this option available to the consumer directly? The next issue was that after I had finished my chat I could not see a way to download the transcript of the chat. Most every other company I have dealt with offers the download option right in the chat box. They told me that all chats are available whenever you are in a chat. You just have to scroll up to find them. This is very inconvenient because you have to search when one chat ends and the other starts. It is much easier, for me, to be able to have them saved to file and titled so I can access them whenever I want to. They also suggested that I could take a Screen Shot of the chat. That doesn't make any sense because if the chat is very long it would take numerous screen shots of the entire chat to get all of it. I eventually copied the text and pasted it to a Word document. I don't think I mentioned that during the course of my text I was transferred to 4 different customer service reps and had to regurgitate the information I had already gone over with the previous rep. Not A Stellar Experience. It is a good thing that there are other retailers like Walmart, Ebay or even going directly to the manufacturer rather than putting up with the hassle that I have found with Amazon.  "
Aundria Guyton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid shopper on Amazon. I ordered several dresses for a wedding through Amazon but returned several of them because they did not fit properly. I received a prompt refund on all of them, only to get recharged for one of the dresses about 2 weeks later. I have contacted Amazon about the charge and was told they did receive the item and would refund me again. Over the past month, I have spoken with customer service 5 times concerning my refund and was told each time the refund would be processed, and I would receive it in 5-7 business days, then another 5-7 days, then 3-5 days and then another 3-5 days, but still no refund. The last conversation I had with customer service was that there was a clinch in their system and this was happening to several customers. I keep getting apologies for any inconvenience they may have caused and was assured this time of the refund in 3-5 business days, plus they gave me access for a discount to their summer sale for my troubles. Well, needless to say, still no refund. I have now turned to my bank to file a dispute against Amazon to see it they can fight this battle for me. Of course, the dispute takes approximately 10 days, but what the heck. I have waited this long. I still don't understand what the problem is with Amazon crediting my card for an unauthorized charge."

I know they refund to the original payment method, but since the Hilton Honors account was expired, I needed to know if they could refund to my Amazon account. They offered me a $10 promotional credit instead of the $60 the scrubs cost. I said absolutely not. They said they wouldn‚Äôt do anything else. After HOURS of wrangling and internet searches to find a phone number, I FINALLY got them to refund it to my Amazon account as a gift card balance. But the next day, they removed it all. I‚Äôm done with this company. Never ordering anything again. "

Anna,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I want to report one of the Amazon drivers who worked in Kansas City, MO today, on Saturday May 17, 2025. He is a white man maybe in his 40s or 50s. I had 2 Amazon packages out for delivery. I live in an apartment complex. I saw the driver pulling up in front of my apartment building, holding 3 packages and taking the stairs down to the downstairs apartments. When he was walking back up the stairs and ready to go back to his truck, I asked him where my 2 packages were that were out for delivery. He said he delivered all 3 to one of the apartments below. I ran out and quickly found out that both of my packages were dumped in front of someone else‚Äôs apartment door. I quickly retrieved them and I confronted the driver. He didn‚Äôt apologize, he said that‚Äôs where they ‚Äúpinged‚Äù (whatever that means). Mind you, my packages had my full name and address on it, including MY apartment number. I was very frustrated. The driver walked away without any apology, seemingly not even understand what he did wrong.I immediately called Amazon customer service to file a report on this unprofessional driver but was met by some Indian dude who could barely speak English and the whole time he thought I have an issue with an item instead of a driver. Amazon is completely useless. There needs to be a DIRECT way to report all these unprofessional, obviously retarded and lazy drivers. Instead, Amazon keeps covering for them! "

JS New,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought an item that was an essential product for an unwell loved one. Item arrived weirdly damaged, possibly deliberately damaged.Amazon wouldn't even let me post a review to warn others of this seller, even when I removed the accompanying pictures it was still rejected. Wouldn't be able to get a refund because loved one needed the rest of the items in the packaging as they were unwell and in pain (and would have had to wait for at least a couple, possibly several days in pain for another delivery). But I took pictures as evidence, if only to warn others and so that Amazon could make sure it didn't happen again. Amazon either needs to sort out it's website because it wouldn't let me (publicly) post with pictures or it's being ever more obnoxious not to accept evidence for a damaged product. So, if Amazon wouldn't or couldn't accept the review with pictures, upon removing the pictures Amazon initially 'accepted' (ie it actually gave me the opportunity to post it.) the review but it was the rejected via email.So how many other people is this going to happen to? Because that damage looked like it might have been deliberate.It was a strawberry nutrition replacement meal for people recovering from stomach illness, damage, operations etc sold by Amazon and cost about ¬£30-40. Item had several puncture wounds as if caused by a knife or scissors tip- strictly the tip and not a slicing or sawing mark. One of the drinks was also squeezed and torn. It was the strangest damage. Not for this item exclusively but posting criticism towards Amazon delivery for repeated incidents of damage, on a certain social media website has in the past led to accusations of lying or exaggerating. An aside, merely commenting on Amazon delivering items late when extra was paid to be delivered next day (even if it was needed for medical reasons) were met with ""Karen!!!"" (nevermind that I've only attempted to officially complain about damage once, as this time it was so unusual). Always by several accounts at a time- crucially claiming to work for the Amazon delivery.If they do indeed work there, for a company that supposedly treats it workers so poorly there is some cult like loyalty going on here!"
Chuck Harris,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was contacted by the Amazon delivery driver while I was at work asking me for something called a PASS CODE which I have never heard of. The driver told me that it would either be in a text message or email which it was no in either. So, the driver told me that he could not deliver it even though he was sitting in my driveway at the time. I called customer service to get an immediate refund so I could go to a store to purchase this item instead. I have never been more aggravated in my entire life. First they told me it was going to be 3 to 5 business days before I received my refund, that is not acceptable! They removed the funds from my account when the order shipped, why can't I get a refund as soon as they take back possession of the item? Their financial department was even worse to deal with than their customer service. They told me that I have to provide a photo ID in order to get my refund, what the hell! "

This went on for 32minutes unit I gave up & hung up.This was humiliation tactic he used so I would give up.In the end I called back and got a representative that helped and got it done.Bottom line this account was canceled 9 months earlier and Amazon reactivated it and started billing me for again. So in order for this to not happen again I had to cancel the credit card.The same happened with Disney.

Neets94,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been with Amazon for a very long time, but for the last two years, I have experienced major problems with parcel deliveries. Despite my loyalty and frequent orders, my recent experiences with their delivery service have been extremely frustrating and unacceptable.Over the past three years, Amazon delivery personnel have repeatedly delivered my parcels to the wrong address. Not only do they deliver to the incorrect location, but they also leave packages outside my building, despite clear instructions and the building's Concierge noting that the parcels are not to be left there. My residence is part of a complex with multiple buildings, and the main reception only handles deliveries for the front building. The side buildings are not managed by the reception, and the Concierge has made this clear.As a disabled person who uses a wheelchair, I am often unable to get around to retrieve parcels left in communal areas or outside the building. Unfortunately, Amazon delivery drivers frequently leave my packages in these areas, making it difficult or impossible for me to access my items. Despite my repeated communications informing Amazon of these issues, they have largely ignored my concerns.A particularly troubling incident occurred a few months ago when they left a large order in the communal area of my building. I had to go in my wheelchair to retrieve these items, which was inconvenient and distressing. I even provided video footage showing where the drivers left my parcels, hoping this would help resolve the issue.When I contacted Amazon customer service to complain and request that a manager review my case, I was asked to verify my identity by providing my passport. I inquired why this was necessary, and they claimed it was part of an investigation‚Äîimplying potential fraud. I was confused and frustrated, as I assured them it was not my fault that the parcels were being miss-delivered. After a lengthy 45-minute call, they finally admitted they needed to check whether I was committing fraud but refused to accept that the delivery issues were their responsibility.What‚Äôs more concerning is that they told me I am blocked from placing any new orders until I provide my ID. How can I trust them with something as serious as my passport details when they have treated me so poorly and mishandled my deliveries? This demand and the way they‚Äôve dealt with me feels both unfair and discriminatory.This approach is unacceptable. It feels as though Amazon is more interested in investigating me rather than addressing the root problem: their delivery drivers repeatedly fail to deliver parcels correctly. The fact that they are withholding my packages until I provide personal identification, and are conducting investigations on me, is again shocking and discriminatory.As a customer who has spent significant money on Amazon products, I expect better service, accountability, and respect. Their current handling of my situation has left me feeling ignored and mistreated. I sincerely hope Amazon takes these complaints seriously but sadly they don‚Äôt and cannot image how they will improves their delivery practices and customer support."

With arthritis i was left to hand wring a whole week‚Äôs washing.  Now it seems it is the electronics or something to do with its installation maybe but we have organised its return to Amazon on 24th May‚Ä¶and all that ime with no washing machine of course.  We were told by Amazon online C/S shockingly that our installation cost ¬£40 will not be refunded and we have to have it disconnected and drained ourselves at our own cost???  How is this fair Amazon?  This appalling policy has made me very wary of purchasing white goods from Amazon now.  Buyer beware!

Ice Dry,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon customer, but this has been one of the worst and most humiliating experiences I‚Äôve ever had with any company.I‚Äôm trying to resolve a refund of two items ($12.99 each) that Amazon processed to a debit card linked to a bank account that I closed months ago. I informed Amazon of this repeatedly. I clearly explained that the bank would reject the payment and return the funds to Amazon ‚Äî all they had to do was track the rejection and reissue the refund to an active method.Instead, four agents (Justin, Juli√°n, Natalia, and Ruth) hung up on me after refusing to escalate the issue. One of them ‚Äî Justin ‚Äî even processed the refund again to the same closed card after I explained the issue in detail. Minutes later, I received an email confirming that they had ignored everything I said.I was interrupted, blamed for closing my account, told it was ‚Äúnot Amazon‚Äôs problem,‚Äù and treated like I was wasting their time. I have now spent over 3 hours on calls with zero resolution, and the emotional distress this has caused is real.In contrast, I want to thank three agents (Juan, Zahid, and Ang√©lica) who were respectful and tried to help ‚Äî but unfortunately had no authority to act.I‚Äôve contacted @AmazonHelp on Twitter, emailed Jeff Bezos‚Äô office, and now I‚Äôm taking this public because no one has taken accountability.

Plantation,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered an item worth ¬£336. The item arrived but was not usable so I returned it.  I ordered a similar but different make, so I have in effect bought two machines.  They refunded the money to an online Amazon GIFT CARD, meaning they were holding the money in credit.I was not told this, and so I was waiting for the money to be refunded to my credit card, not knowing it had been credited as a Gift Card. Whilst I was waiting I ordered other small items, Unbeknown to me these items were deducted from my Gift Card balance.When I spoke to Amazon this morning, they said that because my last purchase was ""paid for"" from my Gift Card fund, they can no longer refund me the balance other than for it to be used against future purchases.  Having a substantial credit with Amazon means that a) I am without the money in my bank account. b) I have to use it up through future purchases c) it will take me considerably longer than a year to use up the credit during which time I am without the funds and Amazon is gaining interest on it.I now want to close my account, but in so doing I was told that they would still not be able to refund the balance - in short I would be making a gift of ¬£296 to Amazon!!!!As far as I can determine that is against UK law, and I will be seeking ways of using social media, Trading Standards and other avenues to bring this shady and dishonest business practice to the public's attention"

Mary Moeller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Do not trust their 'same day' delivery. They do not notify you that they are shipping it say two days from now and if like me its bad to get a large box in the package room that is several buildings away from your apartment which is why you ordered same day as i get them delivered to my building if its same day and now i will write on the box 'return to sender' and leave it sit there... i really do not want to try to drag an oversized box across several building lots and i am 71 years old. of course they won't allow my review or warning to be shown on amazon. but yeah based on what just happened they don't even merit a 1 star but that is the lowest option I have.  if they had notified me they were changing it i could have gone in and cancelled it. that was probably deliberate.
Nora joy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I'd give their customer service zero if I could. I love Amazon but when they screw up they send you to Delhi! Waiting for refund on a parcel we returned by Royal Mail. No refund. Despite several attempts to speak to someone, having been promised refund under the third party guarantee, still nothing.  Spoke to operator today, in Delhi or someone by the Taj Mahal, baby screaming couldn't hear operator who hung up. Spoke to a Manager who treated us like dipsticks. How can a company who I absolutely use regularly, come down to below boot level customer service "
customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Used to be great now they change delivery dates after purchases. Their delivery times are shocking and its pot luck if you'll actually get your next day delivery or whether the driver will drag it out so long that it goes back to depot where they promise you'll be first delivery next day but of course it never actually happens either. Also not even gonna go into detail about how many returns from shocking quality to wrongly advertised. Yuck. I now avoid shopping there unless I have no other option.
Vuk ≈†ƒáekiƒá,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Abysmall customer servicePackages arrive often damaged due to bad packaging. Tarifs are crazy and for serbia and you often have to pay x2 or even x3 of actual package value which is absolutley cirminal.Customer service is so bad i dont even have the words for it... Iliterate and stupid, obviously form south east asia. Completly incapable of solving absolutlye any issue no matter how actualy easy it is to solve...The best aprt comes. Packages are often delayed in my country but they found a workaround to avoid refunding for late package so they  mark it as ""delivered"" when it enters customs not when it reaches you and they will refund you once if  its late but any subsequent time it will be imposible becouse they will claim package isnt delayed but STOLEN ! Even if you know its at customs and have proof they will refuse to do any action before you go to the police and report it stolen... HOW  DO YOU REPORT AS STOLEN SOETHING THAT IS NOT ? THey surely arent stupid to not know that police obviously wont investigate something that is delayed and not stolen. Hence they will just stonewall you and insist its stolen and they cant do anything without police report... So yeah i would avoid at all costs. Pity that for most merch you dont really have other choice when living in small European country..."

Joseph Papsidero,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This is about Amazon Fire Tablets.After you receive the tablet periodically when you are online Amazon will load unwanted apps to your tablet like FreeVee and Luna and they cannot be uninstalled or deleted.  Amazon customer service is useless; none of their responses address the issue at hand.  My advice is to stay away from Amazon branded tablets.

Anyway, this is all irrefutable, my claim on an IPhone care contract has been refused because Apple believe  the phone was probably stolen. Amazon say post it for,repair,as the latest, or contact manufacturer. As a 26 year long customer I now need to exit a rotten relationship. Hassle but worth it.

Ira,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Prime renewal billing adds a small amount for 'tax'. Three weeks ago, I queried what the tax was for, as the amount made no sense at all and no one on the phone knew. They said that a supervisor would get back to me with a full explanation via email, but I have still not heard back. While the dollar+ amount charged may be minimal, if the charge isn't proper, then since Amazon has over 200 million Prime subscribers, it's getting over $200,000,000 extra revenue that it is not entitled to have each year!"
Cathy Ott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"7 of my last 8 orders have gone through a distribution center, < 50 miles from my home and have taken an extra 24 hours minimum to be delivered. Their website says the packages left this distribution center early in the morning, but they never get here. They have to wait until the next day even though I have paid extra to have them delivered that day.  The latest was today.First of all, I ordered four items, three of the same necklace and a set of fabric pens.Two of the necklaces were split off and sent as a separate package.They are now sitting two miles from my home with a note on the web, saying that the driver has a few more deliveries to make before he can get to mine. Strangely enough, four hours ago the driver had only two deliveries left before he got to me. The other package went through the same distribution center as the last seven and as of about an hour ago I got a message saying it will be tomorrow before it will get here even though it left there at five thirty eight a m, and it's only thirty five miles to the distribution center.  Their so-called service desk has no clue what it means and get mad at me when I get angry. They just keep saying, ""well if you haven't received the packages by Wednesday call us back and we will issue a complete refund"". I don't want a refund. I want my package and I want it on time. Especially when I pay extra to have it delivered early.  My last order was shipped eleven hundred miles from my home. Somehow, they got an address of mine that is twenty six years old. When I called to tell them that the package was 1100 miles away, they told me ""well, it could still be delivered today. But if it isn't there within the week, let us know and we'll refund the money"". If they can't get a package here from 35 miles away in less than 12 hours, it's not likely they're going to get something here from 1100 miles away in less than a day. Every time I go through the hassle of calling them and every time the response I get from their, almost non english speaking representative is  ""we're sorry we do understand."""

It's appalling to receive such customer service from Amazon, and not even be able to get support with deliveries not received. I asked Shane if he had difficulty with reading, to ensure I was supporting his needs, but he chose to perceive it as abuse and warned me of terms and conditions. What sort of customer service is this?When I requested how to file an SAR, he ended the chat. This is a Manager in Amazon Customer Service by the way. Amazing stuff isn't it?Bare in mind, the driver apparently handed it to me but I was in work at the time, so unsure which ghost they've come across at my doorstep.

R I,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's level of customer service is just simply poor.  As a Customer Service Director for an ecommerce company, I would never have treated customer's the way Amazon treated me. The original complaint I reached to CS was about the 3rd party delivery company they were using that misled me to believe my order was going to be delivered.  I received a chat from the delivery person Christina (at 9:32pm) asking to leave a light on so they could make sure they delivered it to the right address.  Nothing showed up.  But the fun started when I contacted Amazon's CS to complain about the 3rd party company.  At first, I spoke to Yakisha and she tried to deny it until I told her I had the chat from the delivery person.  Then she tried to cover it up by stating that the order had arrived late at the local distribution center late and therefore could not be delivered on time.  Again, not true as I had the chat to prove otherwise.  At that point, the Yakisha offered to refund my purchase due to the issue.  Which was fine and I accepted, but then the order was cancelled altogether.  I chatted in again and had it escalated as this cause an even bigger delay since I would have to reorder. I spoke to Sebastian, who could barely type correctly, and stated he was an escalation agent.  He was also unhelpful and only offered an apology.  Then he mistakenly proceeded to call me ma'am, which I am not, and he just kept saying that I had to reorder.  Once I corrected him and let him know he should never assume who he's speaking to, he barely apologized and kept on about reordering.  So I asked to keep escalating the issue to someone higher than him. To which he stated, I am the supervisor and there's no one else to escalate to.   But when he first came into chat, he said he was just an agent.  Working at a call center, I know the tactics they use.  And one of them is to do just this.  To avoid any type of escalation when it comes to their poor level of service. It's now been over a few hours and the credit still has not shown up on my account.  Time to go chat again! SMDH"

Philip Mundhenk,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Giving 5 stars reluctantly because I'm prejudiced AGAINST them for reasons related to Bezos' other activities. But Amazon is so darned good, I have to give the devil his due. I've been in retail all my life and the man is better at it than anyone I've ever encountered. So good at it he forced other companies to up their game in a big way. Subscribe and Save takes a little cogitation. To get the most out of it you have to actively manage it once a month a week or so before your next order is due, putting some things off, advancing others, editing quantities, so that you always get >= 5 things or skip all shipments for that month. Sounds complicated but it really isn't. They save on shipping and you save on money. I comparison shop online A LOT - Ebay, Walmart, Home Depot, and others, and Amazon gets the nod more than half the time. I do Prime off and on. On when I need something fast. I'd do it all the time if it were cheaper. Their customer service is pretty good even when you're just dealing with a robot. If you have to get to a human, it's above and beyond once you get one. In this respect they put all others in the shade except for one thing: Sometimes there is no PRACTICAL postage free option to return something even when the problem clearly lies with a third party vendor (eg. they sent the wrong thing). Like you have to drive 40 miles to get ""free"" postage. This is one of only 2 things Ebay does better, at least for domestic sellers, the other being sorting searches by price. Amazon punishes you for sorting by price by including a huge number of things that aren't remotely what you're looking for, but that's a small annoyance. On the whole, they're great."

Simone,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased an accent chair from Amazon Canada. Big mistake!!! Stick with the small stuff!! I was given the runaround in the worst way. The website: the company pretends to be able to put you in touch with the seller, but it does not. When I called Amazon Canada customer service, after going through all their rigmarole with their AI, the recording send me back to the website, refusing to take the call. I called Amazon US and asked to be transferred to a live person. This person transferred me to another person in Canada who then transferred me back to the US. I asked for the phone number of the seller located in New Jersey, but they couldn't give it to me. This is the very worst experience I have ever had with Amazon. If this is how they treat their Canadian customers from now on, then I'm going to have to examine my options. I certainly can get Virgin Mobile TV and I can buy the rest of my stuff from Walmart and Wayfair. I don't need Amazon. And as long as we are being told to buy Canadian, maybe it's time for Canadian retailers to offer their own version of Amazon, Wayfair and Walmart to the Canadian and the European markets. I dare you!!!"
Chigdem Bicak,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I am happy to receive notifications about my delivery. Okay I can not say everytime they did a good job about the place they left with my parcels but still much better than other companies. At least they provide details and they get the items delivered by the time. It has been 1.5 month I am registered with prime and has been using it with next day delivery. Very pleased.
Avanee,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered shoes but due to size issues, I had to exchange them. The exchange didn't arrive on the given date and it was delayed. I called customer service and they kept telling me to wait with no update or no help whatsoever. I waited for two days and still no product. Later they told me that the product was accidentally shipped to a different location. The customer service associates are extremely incompetent, and they cannot do their jobs. They are not in contact with the warehouse team which I find absolutely disappointing and instead of solving my problem they kept creating new problems for me. I called them so many times and still they couldn't fix their own mistakes. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON DELIVERY!"

Micro Chip,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This company slips in a sneaky way for you to Subscribe to Amazon Prime. You make a purchase, they offer to save you shipping of $8, you get asked to choose between the free shipping that is offered if you wait longer for an item, or if you want it faster with free shipping by subscribing to Prime and they make sure you pay attention to the free shipping and keep promoting you to get prime the whole way to the checkout if they don't try to hide that with the extra ads or writing. They won't confirm if you want this Subscription the same way you have to confirm e-mail, phone, and card; they just confirm that you ordered it without you knowing that you made a mistake allowing for Auto Drafting without the option to pay without Auto Draft. $15 a month is paying for shipping just in a pre-pay form and overpriced if you only make orders once a month or every few months. There is no Guest Checkout and force you into making an account unlike E-Bay that sellers offer free shipping without the strings attached. I have known people to have Prime then have to order unknown amounts in order to get free shipping. It's not even worth it for the Digital Movies, TV Shows or anything else offered of you are not a regular site dweller. Very shady business practice to trick people into offers that buyers are not wanting. They will also make it difficult to close your account, make it difficult to remove your card, and they have no real customer service other than a help forum which is no help at all. They have a Contact Us but you only get to contact a confused and useless AI that only does certain things. Maybe steer away from this Company and the shady business practice for money grabs on unsuspecting consumers. Thanks!"

Stefaan Braem,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the Advanced Scar Gel and when opening the packaging I was offered $30 if I would give this product a 5 star rating on Amazon. Easy bucks! This is pure bribery by the seller and ruins the Amazon review standards. I gladly leave a positive review where it is due but I am totally appalled by such unethical marketing techniques. Amazon's Policy clearly states:It is illegal to receive payment or any other compensation for writing Amazon product reviews, as Amazon's policies strictly prohibit it. Amazon takes a zero-tolerance approach to incentivized reviews, and violating this policy can lead to account suspension and permanent banishment from the platform.¬†So, I wrote a review (listed here in first paragraph) on Amazon platform about this practice as to warn Amazon and other shoppers. I received following reply:Hello Stefaan ,We couldn't post your review because it doesn't meet our guidelinesThere you have it. I am wondering how many 5 stars ratings are bought or are totally fake?

Carmen P.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Update: It‚Äôs been 5 days since I posted this and Amazon has not responded. I‚Äôm disappointed that such a large company would ignore a valid complaint about a broken customer support promise.On April 2, 2025, I purchased a pair of AirPods on Amazon.com for $169. However, due to a delivery issue, I canceled the order and repurchased the exact same item later that day from the same link ‚Äî but the price had increased to $199.Concerned about the price difference, I contacted Amazon customer support and asked whether I should cancel the second purchase and try again at the lower price. The agent told me not to worry ‚Äî that once I received the item, they would refund me $30 to compensate for the price difference. I followed their exact instructions and did not cancel the order.After receiving the item, I contacted Amazon support again, and they refused to issue the refund. They claimed there was no record of the refund promise and stated they cannot access previous customer support messages.I find this unacceptable. It‚Äôs simply not credible that a company of Amazon‚Äôs size and technical capacity cannot retrieve past support interactions. I acted in good faith based on a clear promise made by their representative, and now I‚Äôm being told it never happened ‚Äî without any real investigation.I am requesting that Amazon honor the $30 refund that was promised to me by their own customer support team.Thank you for your attention to this matter."

Bill Allen,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Seems more and more often Amazon is being deceitful about shipping dates,I have recent experiences with a posted ETA on the site ,,place an order and the receipt days moves out by the time I get an order verification.Now 1 out of 3 orders seem to be pushed to before 10 PM on a later date.That is the same as the day after.When contacting Amazon, they say simply..we apologize ..let us know if you don't receive in a few days,That is not a proper respose to a guaranteed Prime shipping date,Seems the current process is to call the item shipped early..therefore prohibiting cancellation.So the items arrive late on a regular basis ,,then you have to return,,and your money is locked up for 3 to 5 days.Amazon used to be so reliable..Prime accounts were greatly beneficial..my opinion..no longer seems to be the case.Seems they have moved to more profit grabbing regardless of impact to the end customer.Feels like the Prime Shipping listed on the site is just a hook to get you to purchase certain products, yet they is no priority delivery over non Prime.."

Les Dixon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"When I purchased the computer on Amazon, they charged me an import fee deposit of $91.16 and promised in the text that if it was higher than the amount that was paid by the shipper, then they would refund the amount after three months. The shipper, UPS, does not do customs clearance here, so I had to spend all day in the airport to claim it myself and pay an extra amount for the import fee.I have contacted Amazon so many times by email and by phone and by text, by chat, every possible way. Their customer service is zero. I talked to them on the phone last month, on the 26th of last month, and they promised that within 48 hours I would get a resolution because they were escalating the problem upwards. I phoned them again last week because I have heard nothing and I was basically given a script telling me, exactly all that I knew before, and they couldn't do anything more. So, basically, they've stolen my money and they have no intention of giving it back, even though I have the proof that I paid and UPS didn't. So, i recommend that if your order includes an import fee deposit don't expect you'll get anything back, better to order from another company !!"

Pooja Mishra,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My Experience with Amazon:Amazon doesn't take responsibility for sellers providing used and repaired laptops. They also make the return process as difficult as possible. I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer since its inception. I added gift cards to my account, trusting I could use them to buy a laptop during a sale.1. I bought a laptop in October 2024. It showed that the warranty had already started three months earlier. I contacted the manufacturer by phone and email, only to find out that the laptop had already been registered by someone else. They couldn‚Äôt update the warranty, and I couldn‚Äôt purchase a new one either, as that‚Äôs only allowed within 30 days of an original sale. So, I requested a replacement or return‚Äîand that‚Äôs where the real trouble began.Amazon Logistics, a separate company, holds the delivery associate responsible if a returned product has issues. So when you place a return request, no one shows up to collect the item, and the delivery associate marks it as ‚Äúcustomer not available‚Äù or ‚Äúproduct verification failed.‚ÄùI kept emailing Amazon for a month. Eventually, they said the return window had closed. I escalated the issue, and finally, someone from Amazon helped by placing a return request under the ‚Äúwrong product‚Äù category, which didn‚Äôt require verification. After two months of effort, the laptop was finally picked up. Two months of hassle‚Äîjust ridiculous.2. After that incident, I was hesitant to make another purchase, but I was stuck with the Amazon Pay gift card balance. So, I gave it another shot in January. The same sequence of events followed, and the product was finally returned by mid-February.3. Now aware of how likely it was to be scammed again‚Äîbut still with money stuck‚ÄîI gave it one more try. I bought another laptop. This time, it was clearly refurbished (I recorded the unboxing). Not only was it used, it was repaired. I showed it to a friend who repairs laptops, and he confirmed that the seller had fixed the display panel. I went through the same frustrating return process yet again.From all this, I can say with confidence that Amazon is being used as a scam platform by certain sellers. I sent a complaint to Amazon, and they replied that they are just a platform, so they can't ensure product authenticity. When I brought up the return issues, they said Amazon Logistics is a separate organization and couldn‚Äôt be contacted directly‚Äîunbelievable.I also tried posting a review on Amazon, but got a reply stating that criticism of the seller, delivery process, or the platform itself is not allowed.Through this ordeal, I also realized that laptops are actually better priced on the manufacturers‚Äô websites, with more peace of mind. Amazon inflates prices before sales and reduces them slightly during the sale period‚Äîjust a marketing gimmick.Verdict: Based on my experience, I can confidently say that buying laptops on Amazon is risky. Amazon doesn‚Äôt take any responsibility after shipping, and sellers use the platform to scam customers. Amazon claims they have no control over how their platform is used. If you're buying a laptop, I highly recommend purchasing directly from the manufacturer. Trust me, it's nearly impossible for third parties to offer lower prices without cutting corners. For example, Lenovo includes a mouse and bag for free‚Äîextras you won‚Äôt get on Amazon. You‚Äôll also find genuine bundles like discounted headphones. In effect, the total cost is the same or even cheaper."

I will say they have a good customer service but their logistics partners that ship things specifically UPS are constantly loosing things literally 90 miles from our home, or UPS hires people who can‚Äôt read and they send things way out of route which causes our packages to be late because we get deliveries( not amazons fault but it is UPS the shipping partners fault) 3 days a week. I feel like some what if UPS can‚Äôt get it together maybe they should fire them and let FEDEX handle what they can‚Äôt not that FEDEx can‚Äôt loose things to it just sucks our packages are constantly replaced or running late.

Personally I advise that it will be easier, long term, to shop somewhere who does not train their employees to behave in sociopathic ways to their caller's.I have permanently closed my account, they're not getting anymore of my cash, and I've been a good customer them.It feels good walking away though!üëç"

Broadie,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Thank goodness for Amazon Logistics. Yes you might have the odd experience of a missed delivery but overall they are excellent and what and when you were promised does happen. Yet for all these brands who profess to manage their delivery (see recent reviews) they don't manage at all. And generally poor logistics goes hand in hand with poor customer service. So hats off to Amazon who make the art of managing logistics look easy. 
Vladimir Bjelajac,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had a terrible experience with Amazon customer support. Someone hacked my account and placed a $500 gift card order. First rep told me they canceled it and I just needed to wait 2 days. After 2 days, another rep said it wasn‚Äôt canceled at all and escalated it again. Then a third rep told me I had to send an email to a different department to get it canceled‚Äîwhich I was never told before. Every agent gave me a different answer, nobody followed up, and I had to chase them myself for days. Meanwhile, I couldn‚Äôt verify my account or buy anything else, and I missed out on sales.

Disgruntled,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Once again !  I have Amazon Prime. This says delivery is supposed to be next day. So why constantly is Amazon changing time of delivery all day to 6pm to 10pm making you stay in ALL DAY AND EVENING then not turning up AT ALL.  Getting worse and worse with deliveries and in our flats IF they do turn up they dump and run at entrance even tho signs saying do NOT leave here but deliver to actual flat as they are supposed to !!!  WTF. And Amazon do nothing about these lazy drivers. NOTHING.

But then they retracted the decision for greed, like all the others that submit to Trump's abuse.I'm greatly disappointed, Amazon.

However, no evidence has been provided to support this claim, and no action has been taken.I have asked for proof of escalation and the names of those who allegedly received my feedback, but these requests have been dismissed.

Despite my many attempts to have them look into and correct the situation they have not notified me that rectified it, and it appears that I am going to to be unfairly charged for the Logitech equipment.

Toika Jackson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On April 7, 2025, I purchased this product from Amazon, anticipating my upcoming trip on May 3rd. Unfortunately, the item arrived used, with worn and bent components, and lacked both the instructions and the highway pegs. The images below, provided by my mechanic, clearly illustrate the extent of the damage. I promptly reached out to Amazon for a refund, intending to reorder the product immediately. The customer service representative, who identified herself as Diana, though I suspect it might not have been her genuine name, informed me that I needed to return the product first before a refund could be processed. I explained that I required the replacement by Thursday. Initially, she insisted that the product was unavailable, but then suggested that I could either receive a refund in the form of an Amazon gift card or a mailed check. I argued that I should not have to wait or bear the cost of acquiring replacement parts when the inventory clearly indicated that 20 items were still available. I have ordered these parts before, but due to an unfortunate accident, I now must replace them. It is unacceptable that the product was sold in such a used and damaged condition, and the customer service was disappointingly unaccommodating. I will certainly be reaching out to the company directly. See the attached picture for evidence."

I open the box, and inside is a tiny tube of BB cream. Definitely not what I ordered.When I got off work, I reached out to Amazon, and I screen recorded the chat for my own protection. The person put in a replacement order at no additional cost. He told me to throw the skin cream I received away. After I got done with the live chat I received an email stating if I did not return the items I never received by May 29. 2025 I would be charged the full amount. Confused I called Amazon and they said it was put in as if I was returning the items. The person I spoke with said he things he fixed it but to keep an eye on it, because I very well could be charged again. That is not a definitive answer. I was charged once for the order. I receive nothing I ordered. I do the right thing. And then told I could potentially be charged again. I am really disappointed with Amazon customer service. I used to order nearly everything from Amazon until a few years ago. I stopped buying things off of them due to a few bad experiences. It looks like two years later nothing has changed.

JayLee Gracko,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was perusing Kindle books and wanted to examine a title. Unfortunately I clicked a one-click buy button that I mistook for a link describing the product.1. Returning the item itself was extraordinarily difficult. This is exactly the sort of experience I expect from a bloated legacy company and one who prioritizes making returns frustrating in order to discourage them.2. A further complication was the item itself was a bundle of nine items. In order to cancel/return them, each item needed to go through a cumbersome process to cancel separately.3. To add to this mess, both the web and app interface would only list a few of the products in the bundle at a time, making it impossible to cancel all 9. At seemingly random times the order of these would mix, possibly as the refunds for one of the items processed and deprioritized it in whatever order the company sees fit (there's no way to change this).4. But after a certain number of refunds no force available to me could effect any more: the account was freezed out of refunds/cancellations. Only ""customer service"" (please read those two words in the most withering tone your mind is capable of) could handle it.5. Just as you'd expect from one of these megalithic companies, customer service is tiered, staffed with people moderately trained monkeys speaking impenetrable English, and abysmally low on the priority list of the board of directors. After a half hour and listening to the required amount of hold music and being told seven times how much my alleged patience is appreciated, they finally smashed the proper sequence of buttons on their keyboards and told me I might get some of my own money back in 3-5 days and maybe an e-mail or two.6. Fixing the problem--having this one-touch button in the first place--is impossible unless you are somehow an expert in seeking fine print on the website. The monkey who finally addressed the problem, a lovely woman who called herself Cindy in the most polite East Asian accent imaginable, had to read an entire URL five times because a. the Amazon e-mail providing the link, of course, did not show up, b. with all their vast technical know-how and tens of thousands of employees and untold billions of dollars in valuation and numerous text messages sent for every other purpose, they could not text me the link, c. ""Cindy""'s lovely voice made understanding her consistently improbable, d. ""Cindy"" did not use the NATO-Phonetic alphabet. But we did it. We finally f***ing did it, and I got the damned buttons to disappear.d. After accidentally pressing one little button, I spent a half hour on two machines trying to remedy it and another half-hour with two monkeys before settling accounts for my egregious mistake, finally coming out financially even but an hour of my life vanished.1. Amazon, you owe me my wage for an hour. And I'm not talking in the form of a gift card.2. ENTREPRENEURS: PLEASE create a company to oust this behemoth and send it the way of Commodore computers and America On-Line.Thank you."

I would advise anyone purchasing on Amazon to use a credit card, that way it‚Äôs easy to cancel the transaction. And their customer service by chat is the absolute worst.

Mr Steven Coney,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,An awful experience. As a prime customer I have never had a bad experience with Amazon however on this occasion it was a nightmare. Placed an order for next day and normally I get an email from Amazon with the tracking information for the delivery with approximate times however I have planned tomorrow out for a couple of hours for lunch but willing to work around when the delivery was. To begin I never got a tracking email on the morning of the delivery and got a text message when I was out to tell me they had tried to deliver. This was not terrible news as Amazon has in the past tried to deliver again the same day which makes them high on my list for customer service.Things went bad when  I got back home to see a card from royal mail to say it will be delivered the following day. This could be anytime with no tracking.I decided to call Amazon as I wanted to order again and have it directed to another address rather than it getting failed again due to no tracker from Royal Mail. Customer service was so unhelpful they could not give me a refund or place another order or redirect this order. Amazon has changed alot in recent years to be top of their class to actually not listening or caring about customer needs. I don't have the product Amazon have my money and refuse to refund. It's not good at all. Very disappointing!!!

Steven Elliott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This company has become the worst. They let scams on their site flourish, and on top of that, they hold you for ransom when you basically try to cancel an order. They'll give you the ""We're preparing the item for shipment"" even though it'll be ""preparing"" for 3 days. Even if you try to cancel something immediately after purchasing it, it won't let you cancel most of the time. I guess the company is greedy for more money. Heed the reviews on trustpilot and stay away. They no longer offer guaranteed 2 day shipping so just order items directly from the brands website instead of Amazon. Hit them where it hurts, their pockets. "
Matthew,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I got a Amazon gift card from a grocery store and when I went to use it on Amazon they claimed it wasn't a real gift card. It was real because the store I bought it at I go there all the time. I did what Amazon said and showed my receipt and sent pictures of the gift card. You think when you send them what they ask to prove you bought it that should be enough but NO. I'm on disability so that $100 gift card I got to get things was Money out of something else. Amazon doesn't care about customers who are disabled, and they don't care about stealing your money. I also sent Amazon signed statements from workers from where I got the gift card. Bottom line they really don't care about there customers and they don't care to right there wrongs."

Peter Lane,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have always had good service from Amazon until today. I will avoid using them again.I ordered a gift voucher and on the last part of the purchase, it would not complete it until I allowed Cookies.I have keep Cookies to a minimum on my PC for years and had no idea how to turn them off.I had to spend an hour trying to contact a person on Amazon. It eventually transpired that I had allowed cookies and the website was telling lies.This wasted an hour of my valuable time. Instead of sending a gift voucher to the person concerned, I might as well have designed, manufactured the item and delivered it by hand. So instead of a quick trouble free solution I was stuck in a ""Computer Death Loop"" with no way to obtain the item of get a refund.The illusive Customer Services, Live Person, eventually brought the nightmare to an end, I will think twice about using this faceless system again.

Tuesday morning I receive a phone call from a rep stating in my voicemail they cannot find my door and needed further instructions.

Kelly,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I am pretty happy with service and items I may need to find and delivered to my home or other personal residence.  However, I also purchase items for the office and delivery to the office is challenging, frustrating, and overall, unreliable.  I try to avoid Amazon if I need the item for the office.  I work in DC, and for the past year, delivery has been unreliable.  I list when a package can be delivered, when it can not; I tell them to call.  But no one read this.  It is an office building that is not open on weekends, yet they attempt to deliver on weekends.  I  tell them, don't deliver after 6pm because the building locks, I see an attempt was made at 714pm.  Just this week they were going to attempt another delivery but they didn't (they said they would Wednesday; they didn't and they didn't follow up; it is Friday); I had to cancel the order and reorder it and have it sent to my home.  DC may not be the easiet area to make deliveries, so maybe they should not deliver to it instead of making the situation so bad for the buyer to cancel an order and make other arrangements.  Maybe it is the quality of the driver; they are all not the same.  I have called their customer service and complained several times, but it doesn't work.  If it did, I would not be here writing this.  So if the package is small or not cumbersome and you need it for work, don't have it sent to your office in DC.  Have it sent to your home or you will never see it, or they will deliver it during a time when you told them they can't, and not attempt again.    "

If lost in transit you would definitely have evidence. The first transit was by Fedex you would have full details of this and if lost by them details of the claim. The second part of the transit are you really trying to claim you sent it by standard delivery only and therefore had no tracking ? Doesn't make much sense as it‚Äôs more difficult and would only save a few pence, but even if I accept that there is no way that you wouldn‚Äôt have proof of postage.

Amal Paul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Extremely Disappointed with Amazon‚Äôs Misleading Support and Refund ProcessI had a very disappointing experience with Amazon regarding my recent purchase. Before placing the order, I contacted their technical support team to confirm if the product would be compatible for use in New Zealand. The support agent (Adnan from Technical Support) clearly assured me via email that if there were any issues, I would receive a full refund and would not have to bear any loss, even promising a ‚Äúreturn-less refund‚Äù if possible.However, after the product arrived and turned out to be incompatible, the reality was very different. First, I was told via chat that I did not need to return the item and that my refund was already processed (with a 5‚Äì7 day wait time). After waiting for over a week, I followed up again, and a different associate told me the refund was still being processed and asked me to wait another 3‚Äì5 days.Finally, after all this back and forth, when I contacted support today, I was suddenly told that I must return the product ‚Äî and worse, I would have to pay for the return shipping myself, with no support from Amazon if the return cost is high (especially if over $150). This is completely opposite to what I was promised.I feel misled and treated unfairly. Amazon failed to honor the assurance their own staff gave in writing. This has wasted my time, caused a lot of frustration, and left me with additional costs for a mistake that should have been Amazon's responsibility.Very disappointed ‚Äî I expected better service and accountability from Amazon"

Robert Ruiz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has gone so far down hill.I pay for Prime and I no longer receive anything in the stated two days, but more like a week or more.They frequently tell you a review is not allowed which means their reviews are useless and cherrypicked.They took advantage of Covid to make service longer and worse.They no longer ship even fragile things in protective packaging, sometimes just in a bag even if breakable, and often with just a piece of paper thrown in as ""padding.""I just bought a friend a foam mattress topper and the first seller sent a twin when I ordered (and paid for) a queen.I then ordered another from another company on Amazon and when I ordered it said it would be delivered Friday, but now on Wednesday it says nothing about a delivery date at all.Jeff Bezos is just plain creepy and his company has gotten worse and worse.  Why?  Because by now we are at the point where for certain items Amazon is the only game in town and we have no choice.Also, for items you can get locally, it's often cheaper to buy them locally than to buy them at the supposed discount and ""free shipping"" Amazon Prime price.Amazon started out decently to hook people, but now that they've destroyed the competition (and killed actual mom and pop shops and bookstores), they know they don't have to try anymore and it shows."

Paul Wood,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Constantly having trouble with drivers entering rear of my property for 2yrs 4months. I installed 6ft fencing and gates,purchased large signs stating driveway private, this is rear of property, deliveries to front of property only. My dog bites enter are your own risk. Imnconstanly worried my dog will bite and then be put down and im in n trouble. My dog is friendly but im sure she will defend property. Whenever I go out for hospital or Drs appointments as im disabled, suffer with mental health and other health issues. Amazon drivers enter leaving packages ignoring signs. I have regular falls as I have weak knees and ankles and have fallen trying to pick up parcels left at rear driveway. Ive Contacted amazon so many times, told them this is affecting me mentally, im having suicidal thoughts,thoughts of self harm,causing distress, fallen over. Say theyll fix it, report to distributions centres but nothing changes. No care or support shown or offered. I'm recovering from a mental breakdown from 2016 and ive not been the same since. Amazon have no empathy, no duty of care or any kind of knowledge of Safeguarding. It May seem like nothing to most people but I feel I'm being intruded upon, I don't feel safe in my own home anymore. You might be thinking well shut the gates when you go out but I suffer with Fibromyalgia chronic pain and fatigue.  I open large gates once instead of 4 times,it's also easier to just drive back and reverse onto my driveway instead of stopping in small Rd and blocking it and then open close open close gates. I can't do it, my health really isn't good ,I've explained all of this to Amazon who don't care. Pompous little dickead who owns company will get his from karma. What goes around times around.

Jack Wu,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon customer for a long time, but my recent experience has left me extremely frustrated. I purchased an item as a birthday gift for $60, only to find that the price dropped to $40 just two days later. When I reached out to customer service, I was told that I couldn‚Äôt receive any kind of price adjustment and that my only option was to return the item for a full refund.This is incredibly disappointing, especially because I spent time selecting the right gift and ordered it early enough to avoid any issues with delivery. To have it drop in price so soon and not even be offered a small credit or goodwill gesture feels very unfair. I understand policies, but this lack of flexibility over such a small amount has really soured my experience.I‚Äôm going to have to return and re-buy the item, which is both time-consuming and inconvenient.

Winnie Peeler,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's orders are frequently late. Recently, an order showed it was being delivered that day. Later in the day, Amazon said the package is running late. I could not cancel the order online (I needed it for the next day to bring out of state). I ordered a duplicate order to be shipped to NY to arrive the next day.  I called Amazon. A representative said that, when the package arrived, call back and that he arranged for a free UPS pick up at my house. He said he made a note about that in my account. Today, I called back to return the items. The representative said she would credit my gift card for the UPS pickup. All of the items were delivered in one box and were one order. Amazon had divided the items into 3 order numbers, but delivered the items in one box. The woman deducted $23.93 from my refund amounts for the return of one box. I called Amazon again. The man I spoke with said he could arrange for UPS pickup, but it would have to be 3 separate pickups. He canceled the return processed earlier. I would be charged and then refunded some of the amount. I had been on the phone with him for more than 25 minutes. I finally got frustrated and said to send labels, and I would drive a half hour or more to return the package. I could not return it to UPS in my town because a local store that takes UPS packages would need one label. I told him to return the items, and I would go to Staples. He hung up on me. I had to return each item in the Amazon app. Now I have to drive 30-35 minutes to return the items to Staples. I will have show 9 different QR codes to return the one order. Amazon's deliveries are often late and some go missing. The new return process is very inconvenient. It is very difficult to get Amazon's customer service number on the site. Most people would be unable to find the contact information. I have been a long time customer of Amazon, but I think I may give up my prime membership. I am so done with Amazon!"

Adam Joyce,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Would prefer no stars but jot an option I wanted to return  an item that I purchased from amazon and paid amazon ( even though came from a third party seller) unfortunately the items did not fit and needed to send them back. Call number one sent out the wrong returns label as I asked to be abel to drop it off at at evri collection point where I could print t of the label as didn't have means to do it and they failed there second call finally sent out the right shipping info and told me as soon as I dropped the item off a refund would be processed and paid back to my account well guess what 10 days after the first call still no sign of the refund let alone it being processed so yeah another call to amazon where I was informed I'd have to wait 48 business hours for a refund to be processed and up to 7 days to see it back in my account when ive questioned the so call returns manager regards this after being told it be processed after I dropped the item off at the post office he hung up on me nare in mind I dropped the item off on the 19/4/25 and called them today the 22/4/25 so I took in to account the Easter bank Holiday absolute joke of a organisation and when I mentioned the consumer credit act he just brushed it off

Angela Newton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I will NOT be buying much from Amazon in the future! I used to love shopping on Amazon, but I have been burned by the Third Party Sellers too often. Most recently Red's Corner cheated me by sending me the wrong edition and then refused to give me a refund unless I spent more of my money to ship the item back to them! ( You can read more about this on my Google review.) I am sick and tired of Amazon taking down my negative reviews because they don't fit their ""Community Standards."" This is a deceptive business practice! They are deliberately misleading the public by giving third party sellers a high rating they haven't earned with honest reviews. Amazon's refund policy is bogus too because you can't get a refund unless you ship the item back to the seller. So I would have to pay MORE money in order to get a ""refund"". That is not a refund at all! Bottom line: don't believe the hype! Amazon is not trust worthy and they don't care about their customers AT ALL. Buyer beware! "
Brulzie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Tried to order an item through their pay in 4 method, payment requested through my bank was for full amount :confusing:, declined payment. Spoke to a very rude customer service rep who said amazon do it this way, all companies do it this way...they take full amount, reimburse the full amount minus one payment...well amazon, all companies don't do it that way, in fact very few do, and not all companies have extremely rude reps...really sad, I used to like and trust you."
Sean,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I saw an advertisement for a pack of three Fruit of the Loom t shirts priced at ¬£5.40. Seemed like great value so I placed an order for two packs totalling ¬£10.80. Later in the day I received an email from Amazon telling me that my order had been cancelled by the vendor Saca Official. No explanation was given. I checked the advert on Amazon and saw that the vendor had raised the price and was still selling the t shirt packs. Is it legal to trade this way? Seems like an unfair thing to do and terrible customer service. No more orders via Amazon from me if this is how they trade.

Joyce Huguely Overstreet,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,As use to order from Amazon all the time. Their tracking is all over the place. Not accurate at all. I recommended my sister go shopping for a sectional sofa their. Bad Mistake the first time she ordered the tracking said it would there was a delay and it hadn't been shipped yet when she tried to cancel the order. A message said it would be delivered the next day. The next day came it said it hadn't been shipped they refunded her money. She tried to order a different sectional she paid for it she immediately gets a message the seller is no longer with Amazon. Now she's waiting on her refund. You would think they would have removed the seller or not took her money. It's been very frustrating for her. Order anything but large furniture you will get the run around. 
Henrich Keli,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Is Amazon aware of a seller from Aliexpress using Amazon to sell products not available on Aliexpress to me where I did not order that item from Amazon either? The item is a glg210 Soldering Microscope. I ordered an Andonstar AD210 via Aliexpress and got an invoice from Tech Digital Microscope Store.And now the GLG210 Microscope was sent by MICROSCOPE SXWL     6971 OTAY MESA RD     SAN DIEGO CA 92154 -5722and the forwarder said that package is shipped via Amazon and the box DID NOT have the amazon logo on it(strange) and the GLG doesnot appear as any order in my order history on the the Amazon platform. And Aliexpress wants me now to return the Andonstar I never received (which is on their platform and I only received an invoice from that seller that is Tech Digital Miscroscope Store) within a lapse of time for return or the seller(?) will be paid and I will be without any refund and loss of my invested money and no Andonstar AD210 microscope.Aliexpress agrees 100% to refund if the Andonstar AD210 (that I NEVER received) is returned. And that is impossible.

They could have been stolen and then where would I be?This is why I don‚Äôt use Amazon very often, because their delivery system is so shoddy!  I just tried to discuss this with an agent, over the phone, but he just didn‚Äôt understand, or wasn‚Äôt interested!  He told me to contact the delivery company!  What a cheek!

M A,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On March 27, 2025, I placed an order from Amazon for an HP 255 G10 Laptop for Home or Work that arrived to my home two days later. At first, I was very happy to have it to replace an older HP laptop that was showing signs that a replacement was needed. I would be able to continue my writing of editorials for publication. However, before long, I saw that the cursor was making erratic, unpredictable jumps to various locations on the screen. At times, the jumps selected large amounts of text and deleted them. When I had the option of restoring the deleted text with the Undo command, the damage could be corrected, but that command was not always available to use in every situation.Before long, the cursor started to jump from the application on which I typed to entirely different applications. Such jumps were uncontrollable and no Undo command was available. I saw that to get anything done, I would have to use Notepad on my cellphone, select the text, indicate to copy it, then to send the saved text to myself in a text message, then open the messages on a web browser, select it, and then paste in into whatever application in which I was creating a document. Needless to say, being given no alternative but to follow that long, cumbersome procedure to do any writing was beyond just annoying. In fact, I had to create the text that I am posting here because it is the only reliable method that works with such a defective laptop.At first, I appealed to Microsoft to see if the Jumping Cursor was a software problem. They directed me to use the Snipping Tool in Windows 11 to create videos of the erratic actions of the cursor. I created eleven videos and organized them on a webpage so that I could present them to Amazon in a much easier format so that anyone who would deal with my complaint would have a very easy time seeing what the problem was. I sent the URL to Amazon and to HP, hoping to get some assistance. Regretfully, my efforts were in vain. Neither company even acknowledged me in any way, shape, or form. I remain with a costly piece of junk.I have already filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, and I also prepared a lengthy online presentation and sent the link to the Office of the Attorney General in my state of residence because they have given me very valuable assistance more than once. However, I still hear nothing from Amazon nor from Hewlett Packard.I am a disabled senior and have enough difficult situations in my everyday life. I do not appreciate being forced to go to battle when I am not responsible for the defective item. I am a published writer in three languages and am quite capable of creating very powerful presentations to make my problem known to everyone near and far. I just resent being put in this situation.At age 73, I face enough difficulties in my life. I am beyond being angry, but what angers me the most is that I stand no. chance of receiving any kind of assistance. I've already learned that nobody wants to help someone at my age. That hurts far worse than I can describe."

Firas El Omar,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro X Limited Edition headphones through Amazon. Upon arrival, the left earcup had immediate distortion issues ‚Äî a defect I verified using multiple audio sources, amps, and cables. Unfortunately, I had to leave the U.S. the next day for work, making me unable to access Amazon‚Äôs return options, which are limited to U.S.-based drop-off only (Whole Foods, UPS, etc.).I contacted Amazon customer support seeking an international return alternative or deadline extension. Instead, I was transferred between six different agents, forced to repeat myself every time. One agent rudely ended the chat, others gave generic policy responses, and none were empowered to provide any real solution. I clearly stated I was willing to pay international shipping myself ‚Äî I just needed a method.Ultimately, I emailed ""jeff"" on his amazon.com, as customer support failed me entirely. The experience was disappointing and stressful ‚Äî not what you'd expect from a global company like Amazon. It should not be this hard to return a defective product, especially when the customer is acting in good faith.I hope this review reaches someone at Amazon with the power (and care) to improve this process for others in similar situations."

Thomas Hudzik,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"It's hard to watch their business model erode in real time, but that is unfortunately the case.

Absolutely no activity to either resend my item or offer a refund which btw I was told another cat food was reordered. Straight up lying AND stealing. Point blank: you pay for an item that wasn't received; yeah, that's theft. If their end goal is to get us to STOP shopping Amazon and either order elsewhere or in person then congratulations!

An honest mistake? Maybe. But when I reached out expecting a simple fix, I was told I wouldn‚Äôt get a refund because the item was shipped via a freight forwarder.Let me be clear: Amazon offered me a full refund when I first reported the issue, which is the only reason I re-ordered the correct paint (also from Amazon). Now they‚Äôve decided that promise no longer applies because of their fine print. Apparently, if you live on an island and use a freight service (like many people have to), your refund rights don‚Äôt matter.So now I‚Äôm out the cost of the incorrect paint, the correct paint, international shipping twice, and processing fees ‚Äî all over their mistake. Executive Customer Relations reviewed the case and still chose to dig in rather than do the right thing.Amazon, if you‚Äôre listening: please stop saying you care about customers unless you‚Äôre actually prepared to act like it."

The cardboard envelope from Amazon was intact. The iPhone box inside still had 2 unbroken seals and wasn‚Äôt significantly damaged but had a few slightly dirty scuff marks. After opening the box I was shocked to find there was no iPhone inside. The only items were: written info booklet, SIM pin and charger. There has been a theft at some point along the supply/delivery chain. I raised this with Amazon customer service and been going back and forth with them all week, very unsympathetic and keep blaming 3rd parties despite them being the seller, distributor and delivery company. They have been sending me generic email template responses and refusing my refund requests. Despite producing a Police Crime Reference number they want more sensitive info and in a format that doesn't comply with the UK police's own legal proceedings and data privacy policy.Moderators/algorithms also keep taking down my review on Amazon's product page, censoring this story - 3rd time trying to post now!Update:Customer service was terrible and ended up processing a debit card chargeback with my bank for a refund, so far Amazon haven‚Äôt contested this."

Ryan Whiteside,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am trying to buy an Airbnb Gift Card on Amazon to book an Airbnb for myself. I used my Amazon Prime Credit Card to earn 5% rewards on purchases, including Gift Cards. I wanted to buy an Airbnb for $1983.32. I first tried to buy a $1000 Gift Card, then one for $9832.32, and another for $56.15 using rewards from another card. These transactions were blocked as suspicious. I had to reset my password and do two-factor authentication. When I called Amazon Customer Service, they said it would take 24 to 72 hours for an investigation. I received wrong information from the representative, who said I could repurchase the gift cards, which was not true. I called again and got more wrong information from another representative, who said all my transactions would be canceled, but the $56.15 gift card was processed. I contacted Amazon via chat, and someone called me to ask about the gift cards. After I confirmed, the $1000 transaction went through. I still needed a $900 gift card, and he said he would note it, but that transaction did not go through and has been pending for days. I made at least 5 attempts to fix this issue, but instead of help, I received misinformation. I suggest Amazon fix this problem and train its employees better to avoid spreading wrong information. They also need to improve their systems that block legitimate transactions. "

Bandit,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Put in a huge order 5 minutes before midnight because I was wrongly informed that some items the sale ends at midnight. The next morning got an email from a manufacturer and tried to cancel the lenses (5 for hundreds of $ each) and discovered FIVE items had shipped from the same fulfillment centre whilst I was sleeping. I guess Amazon must be desperate to get items out ASAP so you can't cancel. Was given different info from agents, was offered $25, $150, $250 and no limit for shipping to return items. Why not send the courier to my home to collect like they used to? Returned everything in the same box with all requested information printed and attached. Amazon received the returns and there was no contact so after 30 days started complaining. I PROVED that and agent had deliberately lied in order to save Amazon money (supervisor apologised but I believe Amazon trains the customer service agents to lie on their behalf because this was the 2nd time I was able to PROVE that they had lied to short change me). I spent a total of 17 hours online fighting to get a refund for firstly the one lens, then the other, then the amp then the shipping. Lying, thieving scum with worse than third world service (I should know, I live there). Obviously business is bad and now they are stealing as much money as possible before the inevitable collapse of the West because persons like Besos are too stupid to do business properly. Customers are just a resource to be milked and when they are through they are slaughtered and hopefully cheat the purchaser of the final rotting product!"

Unhappy In NY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Be very careful with Amazon. com as the company misrepresents merchandise, policy, has no desire to honestly correct such misrepresentations or provide any semblance of customer service in an effort to make a sale. The staff are equally dishonest and have no desire to provide any customer service as they will claim to not see what is clearly shown on their webpage or offer a resolution. I purchased a Travelpro Platinum Elite 29"" Softside checked Bag, 4/7/2025, from Amazon through my roommate's prime account. The webpage clearly indicates a free return was available. I was not happen with the color and signed in to Amazon.com to exchange the luggage for a different color. The only option was to go through the vendor at a shipping cost of $27.14. No other option was provided. A telephone call to Amazon customer service, 4/14/2025, proved frustrating and fruitless. The representative insisted that there was no specification promising a free return and she could not see it on the webpage. I informed her that I was looking at the webpage, where it was located, and clearly stated a free return was available. I offered to send her a screen shot. She declined to accept the screen shot and insisted that i would have to pay the fee to return the suitcase."

john Shen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon need to alter their policies.  Using rogue couriers and the system does not recognise items not delivered but said they are. Tells you - they have been delivered and come back in a  few days to see if they can help. Numerous complaints have been made about the couriers yet all their surveys do is collect data and not address. Your time and money is therefore at risk. Amazon - you need to pull your socks up and address your rogue couriers.
Andrew A Brown III,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Customer Service does not communicate to their customers well, they give their customers the run around and don‚Äôt care for the product they spent their hard earned money on, when speaking with Customer Service you‚Äôll have one representative tell you one thing while the other one will tell you completely different that will have you guessing and wondering what‚Äôs going on with your shipment, this has happened constantly and they seem to not care, don‚Äôt want to resolve the issue at all, I urge anyone else dealing with this problem to shop somewhere else, rather than shop here and have your money played with."

And when I called back every time I was told it wasn't done and I was waiting on something that wasn't going to happen. I don't know about y'all but my time is very important to me and I don't want to deal with a company that doesn't care about my time.

Dianne Harmon,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Prime member for many years, but shipping has changed so dramatically, I'm considering ending Prime membership.  I typically buy only 'Prime' and avoid 3rd party sellers (you can get better pricing on Ebay for lower pricing for this kind of quality).  More than half of orders take a week, all too often 10-20 days (I'm excluding orders I opt to receive with my weekly box).  Even when the initial order indicates a 3-5 day delivery window, I repeatedly get emails stating 'your delivery has been delayed', and end up taking at least 1-5 days longer than origianally stated.  I understood when Covid was in the way, but not for the past two years ('23, '24, '25)."

Loeffler Axelrad,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been shopping with Amazon for nearly a decade, and it used to be flawless‚Äîfast Prime shipping, great customer service. But lately? It‚Äôs become a total mess.1. Shipping Delays:Prime used to mean next-day delivery. Now? Half my orders take 3-4 days, even with Prime. And if it‚Äôs a third-party seller? Forget it. Once, my package got ""lost,"" and it took a month of back-and-forth just to get a refund.2. Customer Service Nightmare:Before, a quick chat would solve any issue in minutes. Now? You get stuck in bot loops, and if you finally reach a human, they just transfer you endlessly. I spent 45 minutes last week just to get a simple return label!3. Flooded with Cheap Junk:The marketplace is now overrun with shady Chinese knockoffs disguised as legit products. I have to dig through reviews and seller ratings just to avoid scams. Why is Amazon letting this happen?The Bottom Line:Amazon is still convenient, but if things keep getting worse, I‚Äôll switch to Walmart or local stores.

Debby Quashen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"First of all for whatever reason even though I have an account with Amazon they've made it impossible to login. I was interested in writer Anne Stuart's series The House Of Rohan. All were in physical paper form except one The Wicked House Of Rohan which was only available in e-book format. I would have preferred the physical paper format. I tried to get through Google Play Books but couldn't. It wasn't available on Kobo or even Walmart etc. I then began to suspect something which  was then confirmed that Amazon is a monopoly actively preventing other sellers from being able to sell the e-book version. This was later confirmed when I found out that the Federal TradeCommission along with 17 state Attorney's General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon in 2023 for unethical practices of various sorts. Writers like Anne Stuart have beneficial relationship with Amazon at the expense of her core, and loyal readers. Even public libraries are suffering from being unable to get the books that they need. Amazon charges a fee to sell on their site  which  nothing less than extortion. If the FTC wins their case hopefully books such as The Wicked House Of Rohan and others not available now will be soon."

The delivery confirmation stated the item had been handed to the resident (me).  Amazon say nothing can be done until ""after an investigation"". ""No replacement cartridges can be sent"". ""Its impossible"". I cannot print my documents. Delivery was too early, driver did not wait for me to answer the door. Driver delivered item to wrong letterbox. Driver lied about delivery. Amazon has no solution. Amazon is utterly useless, their drivers lie, leave parcels on the doorstep where they are stolen, put them through the wrong letterboxes, fabricate the delivery.

Richard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The ad for the MX Keys S keyboard is deceptive. It contains the words ""Programmable"" and ""Linux"", implying that it can be programmable with Linux, but that is not true. To do that requires the Logi Options+ app, which works only with Windows and macOS. The marketing video, Automate Repetitive Tasks, does mention that, but most buyers probably don't watch marketing hype. It should be stated in the main description.To add insult to injury, there were only three options available to me for returning it. All three required bringing it somewhere; I chose Whole Foods, being the closest. I confirmed the lack of a pickup option with Customer Disservice. An amazon truck delivered this thing to me, so why couldn't an amazon truck pick it up? Amazon deliveries to my condo complex occur daily. Shame on them. Note that Walmart does have a free pickup service, and many of the products available from amazon are sold by them."
Aleksandr Laevskiy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had an absolutely outrageous experience with Amazon. I ordered a suitcase, and instead of the one I paid for, they sent me a model worth ‚Ç¨150 less.

I trusted Amazon ‚Äî and they completely failed me."
Bob Harding,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wow Amazon has 1.6 * .. impressive.  The service has gone so much down hill in the last year.  Mostly because they allow foreign sellers that do not honour UK buyers rights and you cant get a replacement or refund if the product fails after a few months let alone 1 year.  And had Tanqueray on Subscription but it is still cheaper at Asda.  Think and check before you buy.  Also if you have Prime they put expensive options first.  My wife has standard Amazon and she gets pages of cheaper options before I do ... unfair.

Karen Gayda,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a customer of Amazon since they were a fledgling bookseller. One of their trucks backed into my fence and did a lot of damage. They refuse to pay for it even though my neighbor is an eyewitness to the incident. I sent pictures of the damage along with witness contact info. They never called. They said I had insufficient evidence because I did not have security footage or the license plate of the truck.Update: I have been escalating this incident with Amazon and their claims processor ARC. Stephanie, the ARC rep told me she called my witness last week but their was a language barrier. He speaks, reads and writes in near perfect English. I suspected she was lying so I contacted my neighbor who is my witness. He says he never was called still.I did some research on the internet to see if others were having similar issues. Apparently  ARC systematically denies claims. There is an entire Reddit thread on people's experiences with them. Even with Ring camara footage, other customers are not being compensated for properly damage caused by Amazon trucks. In my case, it was a hit and run incident which is a crime in my state. I am going to have to file a police report and pursue this in small claims court. Given the pattern of behavior, this seems like it is class action suit material."

Sean Dalrymple,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Utah, USAI was traveling in the second right hand lane. The Amazon driver was traveling in the far right lane. Traffic was backed up on the Amazon lane. I came up at about 64 mph in a 70 mph zone to pass the Amazon driver who was nearly stuck in traffic at about 15 miles an hour. The Amazon driver pulled out and nearly clipped our front end before I could slam on the brakes and skid across the highway from 64 mph to 0. I checked my rearview mirrors to to see who was going to hit us from behind, fortunately we had a good distance from the traffic in that lane behind us. I don‚Äôt recall seeing a blinker and I also know that if I was going 70 miles an hour we would‚Äôve been in a serious accident and possibly a multi car pileup with the left and right lanes because I would have to swerve to miss the driver. My 4 year old son and 2 1/2 year old daughter were scared and wailed, my daughter hitting her head on her seat from the quick skid out. I honked my horn before started to drive again. There was no reaction besides the Amazon driver pulling into the other lane to get more speed to pass people.I couldn‚Äôt find a way to contact Amazon for this incident. The only thing they have links for that I could find after 10 minutes was for product or delivery driver complaints. You have to use your account. I could call customer service, but that would take up more of my time during the day and since we nearly died today, I don‚Äôt want to waste precious time, when I could‚Äôve just filled out a form like this one that takes 1 minuteI have photos.Time: about 12:05 near Pleasant Grove southbound.

Sue Carter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is specifically about customer service. I called and canceled several large furniture items that were mistakenly purchased. The person I spoke with said they were canceled. When the showed up anyway, I called again. I asked that they pick waive the ups cost to pick them up from my house. They refused. I escalated to their manager. They refused. And refused to escalate the call further. She went on and on about how the person I spoke with was someone they contracted out to and thus what they said apparently doesn‚Äôt matter. I told her I don‚Äôt care, I called Amazon so the person I spoke to represented Amazon. This bs is beyond reproach. She was the most infuriating human I have ever spoken to. They don‚Äôt care. They don‚Äôt care that they lied to me and said the item was canceled. She said it was my responsibility to check that I received a cancellation confirmation email. Of course, the person doing the cancelling never told me I had this responsibility. I told them to go back and read the call transcript, which of course they don‚Äôt care to do that, because they have no issue with the fact that the guy blatantly lied and said the items were canceled. Amazon used to make a big deal about how great their customer service was. Those days and gone and dead. Now they are deliberately lying and will do nothing to ‚Äúmake it right‚Äù. I have never been so angry at a customer service rep in my life. How these people show up to work everyday is beyond me.

I received one email saying I was entitled to a refund as it had been more than the 14 working days turn around, I replied to accept as it seems like my device has been lost. I have not heard anything since.I have been on customer service chat and phone call. I keep being told 48hrs for a response from the repair team regarding my refund and the response never comes.I have been denied talking to a manager, and when I finally get through, I am disconnected or hung up on before they even speak to me.My daughter has SATs this year and is unable to use her device for revision.I have waisted hours of my time chasing this repair, now refund.Absolutely appealing customer service. For an advertised warranty, the normal fire tablets are half the price. I purchased the kids devices purely for their warranty. Amazon have broken their agreement and are not communicating with me "

A L Barry,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Should be a zero.   Order a file cabinet that requires a cement block in front to not fall over!   Then after 2 months the topdrawer on the right everything let goand fell off into the 2nd drawer.  Clearly not a well constructed file cabinet and destined to be in a landfill less than a year! Neither the Chinese company Devaise or Amazon gives a damn.  They took my money and basically gave me the finger! 
Yaser Lee,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been selling on Amazon for years, but this recent experience has been the most frustrating and disappointing yet.I used Amazon's Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) to ship a customer's order and paid over $70 in shipping fees. And the product cost $1300+. The package (tracking number: 1ZGG84590302439259) was damaged by Amazon‚Äôs own carrier, and the tracking status clearly shows: ‚ÄúDamaged by carrier.‚ÄùWhen I contacted support to request reimbursement, Amazon told me that I‚Äôm not eligible for compensation because the order was placed on Amazon.com, and they claim MCF cannot be used to fulfill Amazon.com orders. Seriously?Let me be clear ‚Äî I used Amazon‚Äôs own service, paid them directly for shipping, and the package was damaged by Amazon's logistics provider. How is that the seller‚Äôs fault?Now I‚Äôve lost the product, the shipping cost, and the trust in Amazon‚Äôs seller support system. Their response? ""This case is closed. Even if you present new arguments, we won't change the decision.""If Amazon damages a product, Amazon should take responsibility. Period. Hiding behind technical policies to avoid accountability is unacceptable.This experience shows how little Amazon values its third-party sellers. We are constantly expected to meet strict standards, yet when Amazon fails, they wash their hands clean.Extremely disappointed."

BK,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon.ca customer service are very bad. Sometimes they do not deliver and they do not issue a refund. I tried to contact them but no avail because you have to choose a limited options(subject) and when tried to chose other and enter explanation you cannot because they disallow it. I stopped buying from Amazon.ca except where necessary. They are not on par with Amazon.com

Giles Taylor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Returned a mobile phone because the one delivered was not a UK specification one but an American Specification. This means no UK warranty and apps like Samsung Pay won't work. Returned 31st March still not received refund. Refund estimate upto 29th May. This is just not good enough regardless of any reason. Customer Services based in India with poor command of English language. No help they just give a reply read from a script. Amazon really bad company to use now so I won't be using them again. I will instead use Ebay which is far superior and you get refunds within days.

Syed Shoaib Kubrawi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had ordered a helmet worth approx INR4000. After almost a weeks‚Äô time, they delivered the helmet and it was a cheap helmet worth 500-600 bucks. I contacted the customer support and asked for compensation for inconvenience because for the replacement I have no idea how long I am supposed to wait and I cannot use my bike. They denied the compensation initially and then offered a 50 INR compensation for a product worth 4000 INR. I then disagreed with the offer and asked them to send the money to my bank account and cancel the order which they denied as well. This is my nth such experience with these guys and I wish this disastrous company is shut down permanently. They have turned into fraudsters now!"
Mr & Mrs Mcdonald,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I have been a good customer of Amazon for several years now but lately whatever I order Amazon deliver  between 19.00 and 21.00.I have tried to reach Amazon's Customer Service but it would be easier finding the missing link between man and ape.

Bal√°zs N√©meth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I subscribed to Amazon Prime, but they charged me not the monthly fee I set, but the annual fee. Gang of thieves. You can't file a complaint, if you tell them you won't get your money back."
Mark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon couriers clearly think it's OK to leave a parcel anywhere and record it as ""Delivered"".   Which in my case has been on my doorstep, which is right next to the pavement,  with a school,  a pub and shops opposite, so lots of passers by and a very high chance of being stolen.  Oh, and they can't be bothered to press the Ring doorbell, instead they'll give a light knock of the door at best before scarpering and leaving the parcel. Personally I can't stand Amazon, so on the very rare times I do get something, the girlfriend places the order, and it's usually delivered to hers.  But they do the exact same thing there. Leaving items on the doorstep in plain view unless their motion triggers her Ring doorbell and she then has to remind them (again) of where to leave any parcel safely.  Amazon might think trying to leave items such as a ¬£400 Dell 4k Monitor on a doorstep, but the rest of us don't!"
Steve Moorehead,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon cares more for the dishonest sellers than honest buyers!!!! Also they them selves will take your money with out asking !

Was not allowed to wait for shipping.So  I signed for Prime TV for a month they took a years worth off my credit card with out asking !! CROOKS

I have a female Chihuahua who won‚Äôt go outside if it‚Äôs raining, snowing or cold, hence the potty pads, which she‚Äôs very good at using. I can count on Amazon to deliver them overnight if needed. I‚Äôve never had a problem getting them as they are always available when I need them and Amazon will always deliver when I need them and they just happen to put my other two items which were all bought separately, in the same box which I greatly appreciated.

Kevin Morad,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I use to love Amazon now no failing the consumers your false deals are a mirage as prices just went up. Good job millionaire corporations are a disgrace to anyone's image they should discard himself not taking a mere 20-minutes Ceo is far too busy with his less important work tasks instead likely abusing hard workers also not fixing the websites UI. So if my dad drops our shared prime one day you'll know why he did shit company arrogance with his name on it not mine. I'd be paying for your prime at age 29 that should be proof enough however I changed to resentment over the years that said you want people to die or inevitable lawsuit & financial suffering like they did with BOEING airplanes sure not my concern I'm here myself just one product every 3 months I don't care if it took one week to ship again idiots you lose!
zoolane,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered an induction cooktop plus a tri clad, 6 quart induction stockpot. The cooktop arrived 2 day later, and the stainless steel tri-clad pot was supposed to be delivered by April 6.  When looking at shipping details, the stainless steel stockpot indicates it is being prepared for shipping, and it has said so ever since April 3, 2025. It is now 5 days later, and it is still being prepared for shipping. I have been disconnected twice (hung up on) from customer service, told to cancel the order, told to reorder the pot, told there was additional problems and that I would have to wait for an investigation that could take 72 hours, and again told to reorder the $65 pot that I already paid for. Customer service appeared to be able to do so much more years ago, but not any more. Even though Amazon knows that I paid for an item that was not shipped, I still had to pay for the item, then trust then to keep their word about a refund at some later date.UPDATE, April 11: Amazon did NOT refund my money, nor did they cancel the original pot, and decided to ship the pot instead. Now I have two pots, and hope I can still get a refund on one of them."
Ian Wallace,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered whisky, Didnt arrive so I had to do some digging around on site.

Thaise Amaranta,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing to report a very frustrating and unresolved experience I‚Äôve had with Amazon's customer service in the United States.The issue began when a package I ordered was marked as ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù by the carrier, even though I never received it. According to the tracking information, the item was supposedly left at the door of the delivery address ‚Äî which is a hotel. However, no package was ever received by the hotel staff.I contacted Amazon and requested a refund. To proceed, I was asked to verify my identity by submitting a photo ID using a link provided by Amazon. Unfortunately, the link does not work. Every time I click on it, I get the following message:Identity VerificationNo identity verification requests foundThere are no identity verification requests pending reviewI have contacted Amazon support more than 10 times, both via chat and email, explaining the situation over and over again. I have received multiple emails from different representatives, but none of them have provided an alternative method to submit my ID or resolve the issue.It is extremely disappointing and exhausting to deal with this kind of circular and ineffective support. I‚Äôm being asked to provide a document through a broken system, and no one seems able or willing to help me move forward.I am requesting that Amazon resolve this issue promptly by either:Providing a valid and working link for ID submission, orOffering another method to verify my identity, orIssuing a refund based on the situation already documented.This experience has been unacceptable, and I hope my complaint leads to a proper resolution and better handling of similar cases in the future."

Ania Kowalska,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A month ago I placed my order.

Customer JB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have never been more frustrated and disappointed with a company the size and stature of Amazon. My recent experiences with their delivery service have been absolutely unacceptable. Multiple deliveries have not arrived at all, and the promised delivery dates and times are consistently missed without explanation or update.To make matters worse, dealing with Amazon‚Äôs customer service has been a nightmare. Representatives are consistently rude, unhelpful, and seem more interested in getting you off the phone than actually resolving your issue. I‚Äôve been told to call back on specific days, only to be told something completely different when I do‚Äîit's like they‚Äôre intentionally misleading you just to move the problem along without resolving anything.When I asked to file a formal complaint, I was completely ignored. No complaint was registered, and no follow-up was provided. It genuinely feels like they‚Äôre trying to avoid accountability at every turn. This is not what I expect from a company that claims to put the customer first.Trust has been completely eroded. Amazon‚Äôs delivery system is unreliable, and their customer service approach is deceptive and dismissive. I will be seriously rethinking my use of Amazon going forward and would caution others to be aware of how little they seem to value their customers."

Amazon has a wide variety of products so it‚Äôs easy to buy everyday essentials to luxury items.  Returns are easy but rarely needed.  I like how they offer you a similar item at a lower price.

Swithin Mutaasa,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My account was suddenly closed without me being refunded for my partly unfulfilled order! I ordered for three items: Ugreen nasync dxp6800 pro, Seagate Ironwolf 12tb drive and Crucial RAM 16GB; but only the hard drive and RAM kit were shipped. For the Ugreen NAS device, a return was suddenly initiated while it was  shipping and the status in my orders showed I would be refunded once the item was returned. Now, I never got the refund, but instead got my account held for suspicious activity and was required to supply the proofs that it was indeed my account for it to be unlocked. I submitted the required proofs but they went ahead and closed the account without refunding me both the item purchase price+ shipping and customs fees!Via chat, it was a struggle to get through the bots to chat with a real person who ""assured"" me that I would be refunded before April 1, 2025. The refund never materialized. Now I have no way of claiming my money since they unilaterally decided to close my account without appeal"

Amazon Rufus will response ""While the product description doesn't mention where it's made, customers note that this knife is manufactured in China, contrary to claims of Japanese craftsmanship.""I think customer has the right to know the country of origin for all products we purchase.BTW, most of these China made product will either imitate other countries design, brand name, and packaged using other languages (not in Chinese) to make mislead consumer.

I either wanted the items to be sent or a full refund. To date I am still waiting for a refund. I can only conclude from this lack of support, Amazon do not care about it's customers, just MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!!!!"

Keeper,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has gotten really bad at protecting their customers.  We purchased a Greenworks lawnmower that stopped working less than a year after purchase.  Greenworks sent us to a warranty shop that told us it would take 3+ months to get the parts in to complete the repair which means we don't have a working lawnmower for the entire spring/summer season.  Amazon was useless in helping make the situation right.  We shop Amazon a lot, close to weekly purchases but after this experience, we'll shop elsewhere or shop the old fashioned way, locally."

Lynda,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I have used amazon and prime for many years.  Always had great service.  But since they allowed all the new sellers on board, it has turned into a huge joke.  2 day shipping?  In what world, certainly not in mine.  I'm lucky if I get things in a week.  And customer service?  Good luck.  Oh and if you buy something from an outside seller, you're on your own trying to get a refund or any help at tall for that matter.  Amazon apparently isn't responsible for these.  Well I'm sorry, but if you are allowing these companies on the site, then you need to back up amazon standards.  I have had so many orders lost, orders cancelled because apparently ""there was a problem with delivery of your item.  We're sorry for the inconvenience"", wrong items delivered and you can't get a refund to save your life.  These outside companies either come up with every reason in the book why they don't need to issue a refund or help in any way or they just ignore you completely.  It's so frustrating.  It used to be a great company.  Now all it is, is a company that puts anyone on their site to sell whatever ""goods"", and amazon makes bank from it.  It's really pretty sad.  BTW, the date of experience means nothing.  This has been an ongoing problem now for quite awhileAn addition to my previous comments.  Since writing it, I have had 3 deliveries for ""Amazon Marketplace"" meaning the companies that are allowed to sell their products on Amazon's site.  I ordered 12 bottles of equine fly spray that is very hard to find.  The box came, soaked in fly spray. There was no packing in the box, just 12 bottles stuffed into a box.  At least 6 or the 12 bottles had the tops and sprayers broken.  One completely spilled out into the box.  NO response as own yet from the seller.  Next I ordered a Circuit bundle, which was to include extra material and the tools.  Not cheap, quite expensive actually.  When I opened the package, it was instantly obvious that it was a return from someone.  The box unsealed, missing part of the tools and vinyl material.  Also the machine I got is a model 4 and all the material that was sent is for a model 3.  I don't know if this is a problem or not.  I haven't tried it yet because I wanted to talk to the seller first.  You guessed it...no response from seller.  There is another order that is also messed up and no one even responds.  At the risk of sounding like a ""Karen"" (no offense to the Karen's out there) I will no longer order from Amazon.  If neither the company nor the seller will refund or fix an issue, then what is the point.  So I'm done. "
Vincent,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon.nl will make you go crazy.Closing my account now after ordering an HDD from a seller on Amazon where the order was paid, then I was asked to pay pay 2 euros of import taxes to receive the package. I found that weird for an Amazon purchase and contacted Amazon services who said the seller did a mistake when sending and they asked me to contact the seller directly, which I did.The seller requested an invoice to refund the 2 euros import taxes. As the website of the transporter is also trash, I had to open an account with the transporter and spend 30 minutes in chat with them just so they could tell me to wait 2 days before contacting them again because the transaction was too recent.2 days later, I obtain the invoice. I go to Amazon chat support to get help to upload it, which i do not receive, but I eventually find the link myself.Now New answer from the seller: - 'It is for you to pay the import taxes'.Wait what?So I contact Amazon support again. The first agent after 15 minute chats says I could contact the seller or he could issue a 5 euros voucher. Of course I am completely mad a this point, why would they ask me to do all this admin stuff if they can just refund 5 euros? And he does not issue the refund of course.Now on the chat for the last 2 hours, I talks to 3 more agents, and none of them understand any of it.About to close my account now.Order # 407-5183133-2017919"

Margaret Wilson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It used to be a good company but I'm getting sick and tired of items arriving late, items suddenly go up in price from when you placed the original order, items arriving in separate packages when they could clearly all fit in one box (they don't seem to understand about reducing waste) and items arriving damaged.

Vincent Vetro,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered an item from Amazon at 5:30 am this morning 3 minutes later I realized I ordered the wrong product.   I tried to cancel the product immediately.   It would not allow me to do so.   I tried multiple times to cancel.   I finally reached customer service who told me yes they were having problems with customers canceling orders.   After about an hour and a half of arguing with a customer service representative and a manager I was finally told the order was cancelled.  This evening I got a notice that the package that I had cancelled was being delivered.     Now I must return something that I cancelled and wait to be credited.   This issue with cancelling my order was an Amazon internal issue but they showed total disregard for accepting responsibility.    What unbelievably terrible customer service!  Be assured I will shop else ware 
Brian Wright,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Lately about 50% of my orders are delivered late‚Ä¶customer service has become a ghost and expect to make multiple calls for a refund of an order that was never received.  This company used to be great‚Ä¶not anymore.  Terrible in every way these days.

Gilwen C.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been trying to close my account with Amazon for well over 2 months now, and they have made the process an absolute nightmare. I initiated the account closure on January 31st, but as of today, April 3rd, my account is still not closed despite numerous calls to their customer service.Each time I try to close the account, I'm told there are ""open orders"" on my account, but the representatives refuse to provide any details on what those orders are. They claim to be ""escalating the issue,"" but nothing ever gets resolved. I've gone through 10 years of my order history myself and cancelled any open orders I could find, yet I'm still getting the same error when trying to close my account.It is completely unacceptable for this company to hold a customer's account hostage in this way, without providing any real solutions or transparency. I should not have to jump through hoops for months just to close an account I no longer want. This is an unjust and frustrating experience that no customer should have to endure.I would strongly advise anyone considering doing business with Amazon to think twice. Their complete disregard for customer service and unwillingness to properly close accounts is unacceptable. Save yourself the headache and find a company that actually values its customers."
Andrew Mallinson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Apalling.  Made two orders recently.  Goods were perfect.  I have no complaints on that.The problem I have is I phoned customer services as my account logged out and I could not remember password.  I requested a link to change my password.  It came via email with a code to enter.  I entered the code and it informs me it's sent another code to a phone number which was not mine. Suspecting fraudulent activity on my account, I called them.   Their answer was 'We cannot change the phonr number on the account as they need recent three transaction numbers and I have only made two recently'.   So much account security.   It's a joke.I've cancelled Prime and asked them to close my account.  They can't guarantee account security, so unfortunately, I'll take my business elsewhere."

Today i received the message that i can no longer buy anything through Amazon stating that they had previously closed an account of mine?

Apparently i was in violation as i wanted to return a book, nothing about another account so my account will be unblocked within 24 hrs!! pathetic, how can i be in violation because i wanted to send a book back!Nothing about closing another account but  'your account is restricted to digital purchases only due to multiple violations of our returns and refund policy.'Violation = sending a book back!!!Update; why do they lie to you?4 days ago i was told that my account would be reset (system apparently restricts your account)  give it 24 hrs!following day (reset should have taken place the day before) i contacted them again, was told that the previous C.S. operator did not complete it correctly so this C.S. operator told me that he would have to email the higher C.S. team to reset it, still  and i was to wait on them for an email!  still waiting!"

GREGORY HOPKINS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It's obvious Amazon is concerned about the reviews of their company but not enough to address them. You can review the sellers and their products but you can not review the company itself. That tells you, they know they have issues. I have in writing from Amazon they would refund me $181.38 in shipping of a very large heavy item I drove 35 miles to a UPS hub to ship. I have in writing, the instructions from their customer service supervisor telling me exactly how to handle it to get a guaranteed refund. I have in writing ftom another customer service Rep, I had been refunded to my original payment method. None of which ever took place. Amazon subplanted Walmart as the number one earning company in the nation, the fourth quarter of 2024 at $247 Billion. Yet... They lie and withhold a measly $181.38 which I can not get a response. The customer service people just say we report it to back office with no answers. It's a shame their word is one of dishonesty. Make no mistake, I have had a lot of great experiences with them and have been a prime member ever since they offered it, and I have no choice but to use them again... They know it, hence, that is exactly why you can't rate the company and why they can lie and not worry at all. This won't change a thing but let the public know to understand, just because they tell you something, don't expect it to be a fact. "

Teresa Roberts,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered product for a 4/1/25 delivery of which I have done many. Many,many times.  At 7pm or so I got a message that attempted delivery failed.  I was sitting right by a window at that time and there was no attempt of any kind of delivery.  Easy to spot as my driveway is 500 feet long.  So I contacted customer service to find out what the attempt was.  Was told loose dog or dogs.  I do have 2 dogs that are never loose but were sitting in the house with me.  Obviously they were not at the correct house.  I was told they would reattempt delivery but could not provide any evidence or description of the house they were attempting to avoid trying to deliver again to the wrong house.  I would just have to wait and if it didn't arrive I could contact again for options.  I don't have time to spend another 30-40 minutes again as to where it is again.  Requested to cancel order but was told policy does not allow.  Would not refund.  I realize Jeff doesn't need my money, but that is poor customer service that they can't provide any actual answers.

JP,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There was a time when amazon was amazing. Of course this is when they wanted to be #1. Now that they are... LET THE SCAMS BEGIN!!!The Verified Purchase Scam: In this scam they offer fake products. Let us say it is a phone. The cell phone claims to be 4k UHD. It is not it is 1080p FHD. The back of the phone has 5 camera lens. Yet only one of them work. If you put tape (or your finger) over the lens. You will notice that you can only block out the real lens. The other 4 are just fake lens on a sticker placed inside the phone. I could go on about the fake product but the scam is more important. They will then offer a coupon. Now I bet you thought ""cool Scamazon is saving me money"". NOPE what they are doing is assuring that you can NOT warn others of the scam with a review or comments. You see scamazon has their own dictionary. The ""self evident""  of ""verified purchase"" no longer applies. Since you used any type of code for a discount. They can now, no longer verify that you purchased something? Wait, what???? Yes it is true!!! Scamazon looks at it if you care so much about the other suckers they want to scam. THEN PAY FULL PRICE!!! The discount is for suckers only.The Delayed Shipping Scam: In this scam you order something. You are then given a delivery date. On said date your package does not arrive, When you go back to the product page. You will see that the item is no longer available. They are selling things that that they do not have. You can NOT cancel the order. Scamazon will run interference for them by giving you a new date, You must wait a another week or so only then can you cancel and request a refund. So the weeks have passed and you think you can now click on request a refund. NOPE! You go to the tracking page only to see that it is a preship request that was done. It is clear the item is not in transit as they have nothing to ship. You are then forced to have an agent call you. They will tell you that they can give you a gift card (so you can be scammed on something else). If you suckers want your money back. Then you will wait even longer!There are so many to list. But allow me to close with my all time favorite....The Fly In The Soup Scam: In this scam you become a scamazon prime member. Let's be honest, that is the real reason you join scamazon. It was for they video. NOT the over priced, made in china, dollar store items (that you pay a lot more then a dollar for).So you got videos with no ads (since you are paying for the service and it is not free). Scamazon then adds commercials (placing a fly in the soup you ordered). If you suckers do not like the fly in your soup. Then for just $2.99 more A MONTH. They will stop adding them and you can be happy.The irony is that 15 plus years ago. When Amazons web site looked like it was made by a 12 year old. They would ask if you wanted to save your credit card info..... Everyone would click ""oh hell no"" (thinking it was a fake site). This is when you could TRUST THEM. Now that they are #1 you can not as they are a SCAM!!!"
BL,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is basically fine, albeit their website seems messy and dated. Delivery is super fast, but atrocious. I loathe the fact that they only offer evening delivery. Often parcels are delivered super late, and their delivery service has very poor ratings. I would much rather wait longer for my parcel and pick it up somewhere myself, than have it delivered to my house in the evening. And I have to say, stop sending me emails announcing that you're sending my order in separate shipments on different days and make it sound like it isn't a huge inconvenience for me. Now, I have to wait for your tardy delivery service not once, but two days in a row. üôÑ"

Stacey Dobbins,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"How is a company that is worth almost $2 TRILLION not able to refund or reverse a charge for $84.75.  The only option they have is a gift card.  Back in February, I ordered an ice cream maker.  Instead of getting the ice cream maker, I received a coffee maker.  I immediately contacted Amazon to return the item and get a replacement.  The gentleman I spoke with told me to keep the coffeemaker as a courtesy and requested a replacement.  The gentleman I spoke with followed up with an email confirming I could keep the coffeemaker.  I received my replacement, it was dirty and broken.  I requested a replacement and was told to return it and order a new one.  I returned the dirty damaged ice maker and ordered a new one.  Shortly after ordering a new one, I received an email about being charged for the first item, I contacted Amazon and the lady stated I would not be charged and followed up with an email for confirmation.  Today, 4/1/2025 at 1:31 AM, I received an email stating I was charged for the item that I was told to keep.  I called Amazon twice, the second call was to a supervisor.  I was told both times, Amazon does not have the capability to refund or reverse charges.  Really?  I have received refunds in the past with no problem.  A company this size and worth almost $2 TRILLION, has do to better by their customers. If it wasn't for the customers buying from Amazon ALL THE TIME, they would not be as big as they are.

coventry10,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I purchased a brand new up to date Fire Stick from Amazon on 6th March 2024. A week or so ago I noticed it had started to freeze at the opening screen but thought it would something that would rectify itself. Today I decided to refer the matter to Amazon only to find that my warranty expired on 6th March - about two weeks before the problem occurred. We went through all sorts of checks and reset options but nothing was happening. What adds to my annoyance is the fact that the problem I had seems to be quite common with many similar reports of product failure. To cap it all I am a regular Amazon shopper and must spend thousands of pounds a year with them. I might have expected a bit more benevolence than the 15% discount offered on a new one. Needless to say I will not be taking up the offer.

Never arrived (twice), completely the wrong item (once).But what I loathe most are the limitations placed on feedback. Amazon assiduously constructs its site so that a customer cannot say anything negative about Amazon itself. For example, the last item I ordered was entirely wrong - product and size. The image shown to me at point of purchase was the wrong product. All I can do is sent it back and wait 14 days or so for a refund. But the point being missed here is that this is utterly rubbish customer service. And why should they have my money for a period which is entirely down to their deficient processes?Further, there is no way of raising this with Amazon. It is a repulsive company in all respects and it is going to fall. The signs are there - suppressing information, misleading customers, abusing power, controlling communication in sinister ways. And the way they avoid tax is obnoxious - as is the wealth they generate for the few at the top. I hate them. Why are we not getting angry about abuses like this?"

GH,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"25.01.17 I returned my items from Sweden where I live back to Amazon in US (I have bought the products from Amazon.com in the US). Before I sent them I was in contact with an Amazon associate and she was promising me a refund for the shipping cost after they have received the items. Now I still haven't got my refund of the 90USD I paid!Amazon is doing everything, EVERYTHING they can to avoid the refund and to make things so complicated that they exhaust you out so that you will give up contacting them! I have been writing at least 40! emails, they are asking for the same info I have already sent them, as order nr, date of order, receipt for the payment of the return label etc. Then they start with the documents/photos I have sent them as proofs: First it should be uploaded in PDF, when I have sent that they are asking for JPG, now today when I have sent them the files they asked for in JPG, they are telling me that they want the copies in paper form. It's absurd how they treat you as a customer!Totalt ridiculous!

I made and order but had to cancel it because I needed to change payment methods I double checked my info especially my shipping info because I had a new shipper address and I have no clue what happened with the systems as I was on the mobile app but it reverted right back to my old address so now I‚Äôm out my package and out my money. Not saying give away their merchandise but I don‚Äôt complain much to this company the least customer service could have done is to put me on hold and see what alternative help could have been given seeing as how their systems did something. I was told they see the address they see it delivered I‚Äôm basically in my own. I could literally feel the rep just wanted me off the chat near the end so I just let it be, made me order again and moved on.

It appears that a subscription to Amazon Prime was initiated without my consent. Since March 1st, I have been in ongoing communication with customer service to resolve this matter. While I appreciate that they have identified the individual responsible and taken action to suspend their account, I have not yet received a refund for the unauthorized charge. I have been assured that I would be contacted, but I have not received any follow-up at this time. They are some of the scammers. "
DeBorah Lewis,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The concept is a great one.  It is so convenient to order and get your items within a couple days if you have Prime.  However, there are a few shady tactics I can‚Äôt stand, and sometimes the delivery service could careless about your delivery instructions and just leave your stuff for the entire world to see when a few steps to the right, there is a place to shield the items that is in the instructions. The shady is I can be in the middle of watching a movie on Prime,  and the next day when I want to resume the movie, there is a request for me to rent or purchased that very same movie that was included in my membership the prior day. I find that super shady.The issue I‚Äôm having now is a new one.  I hate calling India. Yes the people are polite, but sometimes do not follow through. In the case of a refund for items that didn‚Äôt show up because some issue occurred.  Every single time I call, I get a different excuse as to why my refund hasn‚Äôt happened. Then they give me a date & time I‚Äôm supposed to get it on a gift card and that date will come and go.  One guy will say there is a glitch in the system so refund is delayed. The next guy will say it‚Äôs possible the items will show up so refund hasn‚Äôt been issued.They try and act nice saying they will file a report about the bad info I‚Äôve received.  When I ask them how do I know the bad info isn‚Äôt coming from the current Rep‚Ä¶there is complete silence. This amount of misinformation has only happened once before. Usually I don‚Äôt have issues so haven‚Äôt dealt a great deal with customer service.  When I get good effective honest service, I write about that. Currently, I‚Äôm between a zero and a two."

Linda  Saunders,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would give zero but a star has to be added. Be alert as you could be accused of breaking rules of being racist of using hate speech or sexist language even if youve done no such thing. Why would you write a review with those kinds of things in it especially when your conscious and don't hold those views . You could still receive an arbitrary warning out of the blue without any recall. Your guilty as charged but you'll never see any evidence.. they may say it's a system blip but the warning remains so in effect your left guilty even if your not.  You can't find out If a predictive text has swapped a word or someone's hacked your account nothing or if Amazons simply made a mistake..you've zero recourse.  Your left with that on your record!!If you phone which I have three days in a row to find out what your supposed to have said you'll be told a team will contact you by email but there's no email coming. If like me your certain you've not said anything offense hate speech sexism racist comments . Be prepared for Amazon just to let that warning stick on you and your account even if your entirely innocent. I refute that I've said anything I'm accused of . I'd like to see what I'm supposed to have said . If you are fortunate enough to get a manager to speak  to you'll be given the same story that a team will contact you and then the the manager cuts you off!! Great managerial skill.  As it stands Amazon could choose to send a second email randomly out of the blue just because of nothing!!Why would anyone put any thing of any of those topics in a review it's beyond reason. Be safe do not write  reviews just give Amazon your money if you want to shop with them as I do too often. Pay your prime and be prepared for whatever they choose to say about you. Shocking practise diabolical I will never write another review I wish I could say I won't shop there . I'm going to give that a go thoughSubsequently Amazon's team have contacted me and are being no help at all. They are unable to find the review that triggered their warning and want to simply close the case leaving me hanging with a bad reputation unable to prove I didn't write hate speech racist speech violence or anything else. if it's so easy to send warning emails but not find any evidence against you because there is no evidence to find. Why can't they apologise and remove the indictment and state they were grossly mistaken. You'll never know if or when such an accusation could be picked up and used against you in the future so has to be removed because it's a false unfounded allegation based on nothing.  Reputation is important it isn't nothing it's of high value so crucial to have allegations removed and acknowledged as having been false. As the old adage says if it's not written it's not done. So no admission from Amazon means the allegations stands!!!! That really mattersAmazon act like gods their to big to care. But  giants can fall through lack of care Amazon look after your customers

Scott Elkin Lord-Xanthor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Another program of Amazon's in which they scam millions each end of Quarter to beat quota is the Subscribe & Save program. Subscribe & Save, which well call Subscribe & Scam, is Amazons way of reeling in additional sales, with advertised prices they have no Intention of ever honoring.On March 27th 2025, Amazon listed many items. One of which was Amazon Elements baby wipes at $14.48 a case of 810. Extremely low price that Amazon will never honor.If you want them now you pay $19, but if you subscribe which earliest day is April 3rd its supposed to be $14.48. What you don't know is you will never get that sale price,  because end of closing date, which is the date you can no longer cancel, they jack the price up to $21. They did the same exact thing with Zevia root beer $9.98 and jacked it to $43.Every sale price from 3/27/2025 was never honored. Because I took precautions,  Amazon wasn't able to charge my cards for anything!! Despite it past the closing date.This is because I have many checking accounts with no overdraft, assigned to each subscribe and save item. Each item assigned to an account. This prevents a price change taking funds meant for another order.If the sales total is $56, and Amazon changes it to $156, the transaction will decline. Thats because I only transferred $56 into that specific account. Card declines,  no overdraft fee.I also have a card that texts me to ask if the sale is correct. If it isn't, I say ""N"" and it declines.Stops rebills that get snuck in too.Don't let Amazon rip you off.Screenshot all sales and invoices. You'll notice your email prices change too. Thats because it's a webpage, with data saved elsewhere.Edit: 4/8/2025After the above, recorded a very interesting conversation with administration who clearly stated they can change prices on a completed order. This conversation came about when they managed to get around my system that prevents charging if they raise the price.  They canceled an order so extra funds were there to grab when they modified prices on a completed order. The previous rep also modified the payment system and emailed me stating they did this, which turned on a feature that when card declines, they can use any debit or credit card that was used in the past. They also modified the fresh system, putting items on repeat. My bank is dealing with the above issies."
THIAGO SOARES,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A Deeply Flawed and Exploitative Business Model ‚Äì Sellers and Buyers Beware**  Amazon‚Äôs marketplace has become an increasingly hostile environment for sellers, riddled with hidden fees, deceptive advertising metrics, and an abusive taxation system that results in severe financial losses for those who trust the platform. What was once a promising e-commerce hub has transformed into a predatory system that benefits only Amazon, leaving sellers with little to no actual profit after excessive and often unexplained deductions.  #### **Unethical Fee Structures & Tax Manipulation**  Amazon charges fees at every stage‚Äîbefore, during, and after transactions‚Äîoften applying additional taxes that sellers are only made aware of months later. The financial calculations displayed to sellers are misleading, and when the numbers don‚Äôt add up, customer service provides vague and unhelpful responses, seemingly well aware that sellers will raise concerns about these unfair charges. Rather than transparency, Amazon operates under a mathematical mirage that ensures sellers remain in a cycle of paying to operate on their platform, rather than profiting from their work.  #### **Deceptive Advertising & Manipulated Metrics**  Amazon‚Äôs internal advertising system is another tool used to siphon money from unsuspecting sellers. The numbers presented in ad reports consistently favor Amazon, showing performance metrics that fail to match reality. Sellers investing in ads often see inflated click charges without actual conversions, and when questioned, Amazon deflects with vague explanations, citing ‚Äústatistical variations‚Äù as an excuse for discrepancies that always seem to benefit the platform. This is not an accident‚Äîit‚Äôs a calculated manipulation that drains sellers‚Äô budgets while ensuring Amazon takes its cut first.  #### **A Rigged System That Prevents Growth**  Amazon‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù with sellers is nothing more than a one-sided exploitation scheme. The platform is designed to extract maximum revenue from sellers through relentless fees, taxes, and advertising costs, ensuring that the only party profiting is Amazon itself. Accounts are strategically kept at barely break-even levels, preventing any real financial gain while forcing sellers to reinvest more money just to stay afloat.  #### **A Call for Accountability**  Amazon‚Äôs business practices amount to a predatory scheme that warrants serious legal scrutiny. Sellers and buyers must recognize that this is not a sustainable or fair marketplace‚Äîit is an engineered system designed to maximize Amazon‚Äôs profits at the expense of hardworking individuals and businesses. Those considering selling on Amazon should reconsider, and book publishers, third-party retailers, and small business owners should seek alternative platforms that value ethical business operations.  Amazon must be held accountable for its exploitative tactics. Regulatory authorities and legal experts should investigate these abusive practices, as the scale of financial harm inflicted upon sellers is far too great to ignore. If these deceptive operations continue unchecked, Amazon will remain nothing more than a modern corporate parasite‚Äîthriving off the very businesses it claims to support.  **Sellers, protect your business. Do not fall into Amazon‚Äôs trap.**""The more I take, the less I gain,A feast of gold turns into pain.I squeeze too tight, yet slip away,And in the end, I‚Äôm left to pay.What am I?""Answer: Greed (or Amazon's business model, if you want to be specific!)"

Stuck with resale laptop that has issues from previous owners and seller and a dead battery that won‚Äôt hold a charge so must be plugged in inorder to use pc. Plz note I have many product issues that were never resolved at a loss to me. Some minor and some major .. example some products are discontinued by Amazon when you go to your order search to make a complaint/review the actual item has been removed from their inventory .. so then you go to CSR and although they are professional you will suddenly get disconnected with no refund.. This happened with a dud blender and other items that Amazon removed due to too many complaints.

I dared to get a new phone number and now I cannot access my account. I have sent them my passport l, driving licence and proof of address. They keep saying they will turn off 2 factor authentication and I have now waited 5 months and been calling them all the time. I cannot access my account fully. I can‚Äôt have Amazon on my new devices, I‚Äôm paying for a service I can‚Äôt use! I can‚Äôt cancel because I have purchased films and digital stuff that I can only access through my account. There is NO ONE that can help me! Now they say it has to get to the 6 month mark before they will do anything about it! I‚Äôve sent my documents twice, it‚Äôs been elevated so many times, all the say is call back in 48hrs. That‚Äôs it! What a waste of everyones time and money! I‚Äôm so pissed off!

Wayne B.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I like Amazon but as a Prime member their delivery times and missed shipments is getting excessive.My feedback is for this reason alone...The Amazon phone tree is aggravating also which is probably intentional. If you weren't irritated when you called you will be by the time you get someone...  
Consumer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wish I could do less than a star‚Ä¶.Amazon started strong but has gotten to be terrible. Prime doesn‚Äôt give you any priority but you still pay for it. Delivery drivers constantly deliver packages to the wrong house or submit them as delivered even though they were not. Nothing is ever on time for the most part. Packages are lost frequently. Customer service is a joke. Amazon is nothing but greed. I have cancelled my prime membership and will do everything possible to avoid ever using them again. Amazon is terrible 
Daniel Green,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a long-time Amazon customer, but my recent experience was incredibly frustrating. My order arrived late and when it did, the packing was damaged.

J Myers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon is terrible and their customer service is nothing but people who gaslight you and smile there is no help there.

I contact them again and get the same runaround asking if I screenshot the deal before I did I and I don't expect them to fix it again which mean I have to pay full price fore the car parts I wanted to order off them and great wait another week and half to even get them the hell with amazon I will shop elsewhere
Charlotte,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a number of stuff in one purchase - very annoying that I don‚Äôt get one delivery, but split into three different deliveries that I have to keep track of and be home to let them in etc. Plus difficult to find a way to write complaints in the app, so maybe I shall expect difficulties to send back some of the goods as well.

sb,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very bad customer service. No accountability. I ordered , as moving out of a flat  rolls of masking tape. Not delivered .Excuse was that the address  on Amazon 's web site was wrong ,though  it is Waitrose store . Re- ordered and followed it up by  an email.  Not delivered. Result was   I was  left without masking tape  so had to pay for removal company to pack  on the day  of removal which was very stressful and  difficult. which took hours as  unable to  pack before.  I complained. Same excuse given. I pointed out the email. Stonewalled. Managing director not responded to one email of complaint.  That alone shows very bad  customer service .Said I want to close the account and credit paid to me. Ignored. Avoid at all costs. Advised by locals that this was also many customers experiences . Would not even giove one star . Terrible."
Kyle Strobel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to be a loyal Amazon customer, but after learning about its rollback of DEI initiatives and its anti-democratic lobbying efforts, I can no longer justify supporting this company.

If Amazon refuses to invest in social progress, I refuse to invest in Amazon."

Willow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,What is happening Amazon?  I am not using Amazon anymore.  For the last few months Amazon has been running late with almost all my orders.

Goodbye Amazon.  Why your quality has gone down is beyond me.

Joseph,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a miniature mythological figure for someone who collects things of this nature as a present.  The company selling it seemed to be located in California.  The promised date of delivery did not happen.  The item was becoming way late.  I contacted Amazon by chatting with a few of their representatives through their chat window.  The seller DID give me a $5 discount on the item as promised.  One of the representatives said I was getting a $20 gift of money to use toward future orders and that they were putting a rush on the item to get it to me within the next 24 hrs.  This never happened.  Another representative said that I would get the item delivered to my house by 6am the next morning and they were giving me a $15 gift to use toward future purchases.  None of this happened.  Finally, the last representative told me the item was lost somewhere between California and Ohio, was honest about the situation and apologized for the lies the previous representatives told me.  I‚Äôve taken screen shots of all of the chats with the representatives as proof of what I was told.  I find it hard to believe that a little statue is having a hard time making its way to a destination.  I think something else is going on.  I was finally being asked if I just wanted a refund of the total cost and I said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I want the item that I ordered.  It is being used for something specific.  After a number of weeks I am still waiting for a little statue to arrive‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  It‚Äôs sad that a well known company can not resolve something like this and that its associates made promises that they didn‚Äôt follow through with.  I have screen shots of the promises.  Ugh"

N Z,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Just deleted my Amazon account completely and couldn't be happier that I will never use this untrustworthy scam of a company ever again. I remember when this company was considered the best in terms of customer service, but the fall from that reputation has been spectacular. Now, it is the slimiest, scammiest, just downright crappiest company to ever exist. Their customer service agents outright lie to you, saying you will receive a refund, while knowing that it's BS...which is what happened to me, was told I'd get a refund by two different agents for a defective product, but then was told by a third that that was a ""false promise,"" and never received said refund. Even filed a complaint with the BBB, which resulted in Amazon still refusing to give me a refund when I was told point blank by two agents that I‚Äôd receive one, so I just deleted my account all together as dealing with this company isn't worth it to me anymore. Knowing that Jeff Bezos makes $142,667 per minute while there is so much suffering in the world, and the fact that he can't even run a reputable company with that sort of income makes me sick and I would recommend people stop giving this man their hard-earned money and purchase more high-quality goods from somewhere else!

I feel like they are running a big scam which makes me question the authenticy of theory products and their amazon verified prime products ! Delivery agents conveniently mark as ""delivery attempted"" exact at 10 PM IST without even moving a finger to try to deliver! There is no confirmation that said product that was tried to deliver has reached the delivery station! What is the guarantee that the delivery agent is not enjoying our product till the next day or replacing it with fraudulent items? We have to speak with 20 different tele agents, 30 different chat agents and still the product doesn't EVER get delivered on time ! Leave alone before time! It's like Amazon has stopped trying to the best ! Maybe it's high time they had a competitor ! No one ever works or produces results other than bezos  there i think ! Amazon now is run by bozos!

Haynes Javauh,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is honestly one of the best apps out there for shopping. It has literally everything you could ever need, from clothes and electronics to random stuff you didn‚Äôt even know you wanted. The app is super easy to use, and the checkout process is crazy fast, especially with one-click ordering. If you have Prime, the free two-day (or sometimes even same-day) shipping is a game changer. I also love how it gives personalized recommendations based on what you‚Äôve bought before‚Äîit actually helps me find cool stuff. The reviews are super helpful too because you can see what other people think before you buy. Tracking orders is really easy, and they always keep you updated on when your package will arrive. Plus, their customer service is actually good, and returns are usually hassle-free. Overall, Amazon just makes online shopping way too convenient!"

Georgie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Deliveries to blocks of flats are often left outside the main entrance. People passing the entrance could easily pick up the packages.

Troy Boiler,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give Amazon zero stars, I would. Amazon used to be great for buying whatever you needed and having it delivered in a timely manner; Especially if you had Prime. Now, my orders from eBay and even Temu at times arrive faster. Prime is nothing but a money grab now. Nothing arrives next day or two days as it states before you order. You can no longer cancels orders before it ships neither. Instead you're forced to wait until they deliver it. This is clearly an attempt by Amazon for you to keep your order in hopes you won't return it ( Guess what Amazon? I still drop it off at Kohl's). Delivery drivers don't follow instructions per your delivery requests and just leave your packages wherever they please and customer service is no help. Calling them will only lead to them telling lies and pretending to help solve your issues. Such as them trying to disguise their voice when you ask to speak with a manager or pretending to put in a request for a refund when a package is listed as delivered but isn't.Amazon just isn't what it used to be. I truly believe we're witnessing the first stage of the fall to what once was a great company."

The allotted time frame was between 11am and 2pm, or 12pm and 2pm (I apologise for the slight lapse in recalling the exact time).On 16th March 2025, I was notified again by Fantastic Services, through Amazon, that there was an issue with pricing due to an incorrect assembly price (assembly was for one of the chest of draws to be fitted). As a result, I was told I would need to pay an additional ¬£30 on top of the ¬£50 I had already paid. I immediately rejected this request, citing the Consumer Rights Act 2015, as I had paid the advertised price, which should have been honoured. I felt this was unacceptable that I was being asked to pay for their mistake!I have not received any response from Fantastic Services regarding my email. This lack of communication and the continued inconvenience is highly frustrating. Just another company trying to exploit a customer for their mistake.  Very unhappy! "
Daniel Leys,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Prime is just about worthless.  They now charge $8.99 per month for Amazon Prime Video which use to be included for free.  Shipping is NEVER 2 day anymore.  You are lucky if you recieve your item within 4 days.  And if you think, ""well, at least the shipping is free."", it isn't.  Shop around.  You actually pay slightly more for every item because you ARE paying for shipping, it's just included in the price."

Victor Dulait,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Disappointing Experience with Amazon Belgium - Invoice Not ReceivedI bought a Xiaomi 13T from a third-party seller (Blustrada Tecnologia SARL) via Amazon.be on November 1, 2023. After receiving the product, I requested an invoice for tax and warranty purposes. Despite multiple attempts to contact both the seller and Amazon customer service, I never received the invoice.Amazon claims that the seller is responsible for issuing the invoice and refuses to intervene, even though European regulations clearly require intermediaries like Amazon to ensure compliance.I‚Äôve been offered a return for a refund, which doesn‚Äôt address my need for the invoice. If Amazon cannot provide it, I am requesting a full refund without having to return the product, as this is a clear breach of my consumer rights.Be cautious when shopping through third-party sellers on Amazon!"
Tom Street,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I have waist 42 and leg 29 yet Amazon keep sending 38 and 29. They say it's based on millions of other orders. Now two of the seven wrong orders were for my son so how do they know my son's size. Amazon have gone from being the website to go to and are now the equivalent of a badly run Woolworths. I gave two stars for some successes with electronics but the clothing side is a real mess.

H Enfield,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I only need one Amazon account. Everything we purchase is through the one Amazon account and paid for via our joint bank account.However Amazon have made it impossible for an Amazon account to be accessed by more than one person.Here is an example of a problem....I want to order something off Amazon, so I log in, but Amazon wants to send a security code via text message. The code gets sent to my wife's phone, but my wife is at work. That means I can't use our Amazon account. Like a child, I have to wait until my wife is with me to be able to buy anything or check our past orders.The simple solution would be to be able to add another phone number and be able to choose which phone number the verification code is to be sent to. Amazon have not made this possible though.This means I can not log into our Amazon account, check our order history, or purchase anything until my wife is there with me. Have Amazon seriously never thought of a situation where a husband and wife, who live together and even share their bank accounts together, might both want access to one Amazon account?If Amazon insists on sending a verification code via text message every single time I long in, would it not make sense to allow more than one phone number to choose from to have the code sent to?I have spent hours today trying to sort this out. I even started another Amazon account of my own and tried to link them, but it turned out to be impossible.... To even try this, Amazon insisted on sending the usual security code that it's obsessed with doing, but then said too many codes have been sent, try another time.So let me get this straight......Amazon won't let us do something without us verifying a code sent by them first.... but then they say they're not sending us that code, so tough luck.Get a grip Amazon.These days Married couples share a mortgage, share a bank account, share a council tax bill, share an eBay account and so on and so on, but a married couple can't share an Amazon account???"

JoshAV,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Here, you can find just about anything you need. :-DAnd this is their main advantage.

Dan Burton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2 items I ordered for next day delivery (I only chose those specifically because I wanted them for the next day).Both went out on DPD (2 separate vans) and with both DPD could not deliver because both sellers had instructed they not leave the items in my safe place.I spoke to Amazon cs on the phone twice on the day about a refund and was initially told it wouldn't be a problem and would be possible at the time.It's now 6 days later and another 4 calls to CS and I don't have a refund yet. I was told today that I need to call again tomorrow to get a refund. 6 phone calls. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable customer service from both sellers and Amazon.

Anastacia R,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I use Amazon Prime all of the time.  I have had several problems within the last month, but I have sucked it up and have  not said anything...  Until TODAY!!  Last night I was running low on ink for my printer.  I have a very important presentation this early evening that I need colored ink for.  I was starting to panic and then saw that I could get this delivered to me via Amazon Prime today between 4 AM & 8 AM.  HALLELUJAH!!  (NOPE!!)  I ordered this last night.  As soon as I woke up this morning, I immediately went outside to get it...  Nothing there.  I go back inside to pull it up on my account and it shows that it was delivered at 4:48 AM, however, there is no picture showing where it was delivered...  OK??  I go back outside to take another, more in-depth search... Nothing.  I make my first attempt to talk to customer service and explain everything.  I am told that this will not be delivered until Tuesday...  TUESDAY??  I get put on hold while she looks at it.  I hold for about six (6) minutes and the call drops.  I immediately call back and have to start all over again and go through the prompts, etc  I get a different person and ask why it shows delivered (even specifically says it was delivered to my front door).  She informs me that this happens a lot with the system, where if it isn't delivered, it defaults back to indicating that is was.  WHAT??  I am again on hold...  almost 13 minutes this time...  call drops!  This can't be happening, right?  I call back a THIRD time... start all over AGAIN...  I ask the lady that answers to please not lose my call and if so, ask her to call back right away.  Her information was different than the first two (2) customer service representatives.  Now there is an option of reordering it for delivery today between 5 PM - 10 PM.  I ask why the difference in information.  She has no idea.  I accept the new 5 PM - 10 PM delivery and also ask for a manager.  I explain the ordeal and ask if there is any way possible to get it before 5 PM?  ""The system does not give that as an option"".  We go through this for a few minutes and I ask if I can get it on the front side of this new time frame.  I am again on hold and then he explains that he had to pay something (which he says he did) to get it expedited, so no promises, but it will be here by 10 PM tonight.  I explain that two of my orders within the past two (2) weeks have had similar problems, but they weren't as emergent.  I ask if something is going on with Amazon to have such a dramatic change in customer service.  He tells me that there is nothing he knows about and says that they can do an ""internal investigation"".  Will I get notified of the results?  Of course not.  BOTTOM LINE - Although I can't quantify a dollar amount, I will definitely lose money as a result of this. #staciasays #amazon #customerservice #amazoncustomerservice #printerink #inkcartriges "

Emma Henderson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrendous customer service. I had purchased an item from the US that a family member relies on (I am in Ireland), and tracking showed it had been stuck in transit since March 2nd. By the time the estimated delivery date came, Amazon still had not updated their estimate to reflect real time tracking. I contacted customer service and they assured me the product would arrive by the following day, despite it still being stuck in the US! They lied to me continously. I spoke to THREE customer service reps, all of whom told me in broken English that the product would be with me that weekend. They also told me I hadn't received a confirmation text of delivery because it was coming from DPD, not UPS (a load of bull, as I have had text confirmation from DPD before). Needless to say I did not receive the item but have been refunded the equivalent of $70, after practically begging. The lying and misinformation from them is unethical. I don't think I will ever use Amazon.com again after this experience, and it's the not the first time something like this has happened. Last time they sent me out a cheap iPhone screen protector instead of expensive progesterone cream. A joke of a company."
Laura Patterson,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Now in my opinion it is OK for buying some things like accessories, clothes but not with technology.

Jay,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Twice this year I've received a notification that my package was delivered only to go to the package room and find nothing.Both times, after calling the customer service reps, I received the worst experiences that I've ever experienced when trying to get help from a business.The second time, after nearly fifteen minutes of answering the same questions multiple times and being placed on hold for long periods, they told me to wait until the end of the day and then call back. The end of the day came. I checked the package room: nothing. I called back and I had to go through the entire process again. At the end of about twenty minutes of waiting and answering questions, I was asked to wait a day and then call back if it didn't arrive.A day came, no package arrived, so I called back.Once again I had to restart the entire process from the beginning only for the rep to tell me to wait three more days and fill out some form.I filled out the form and waited three days, which would mark the 16th of March.I called back on the 16th of March and the rep told me that it was still being investigated. ""Call back on the 16th of March"".Yes, you read that correctly. When I pointed out to the rep that it WAS the 16th of March the rep said ""well call back on the 17th"". Frustrated, I asked to speak to a manager. The rep told me that the manager had the same limited authority as the rep and wouldn't be able to help me.So, I asked for a number to a regional or corporate manager. The rep gave me the number to some healthcare agency. I never found the number so I called back and spoke with a rep who reluctantly offered me a refund but what I really wanted was my package. "

Also, I had purchased a Toakeli smoothie blender that broke down and stopped working after only 4 months. When I called, Amazon said they couldn't help me because it was past their time limit. The product has a one-year warranty and prime refused to give me a phone number associated with their account because I could not find one online. Isn't that illegal too? So I was jipped out of a $60 blender that they won't make good on. I am going to look further into making a legal complaint with this company that morals have gone way downhill. They sell a lot of products from overseas and don't pay attention to who they're buying from and they Don't Care about Us. Be careful with this company.

Miss Kelly Wainwright,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could have put zero stars I would have.ive had to abbreviate the swearing as it wouldn't let me post it I've been an amazon prime customer for many years but after the way they have dealt with a recent incident involving one of there drivers I won't be using them again.This all started because the amazon drivers were continuing ignoring the note on my account and on my front door telling them to leave all parcels behind the gate, the note on my account states that the inside door is broke and my mastiff can get loose, the times i have phoned amazon telling them that this is being ignored was ridiculous.  So this driver ignored my delivery details again and caused my dog to get loose, it was dark and i couldnt see her but then i heard someone shouting and what sounded like kicking and i heard my dog react, there was a woman with the driver so when she walked up the road i just said ,did someone kick my dog? From this the man verbally abused me horrifically initially shouting no one touched your dog you fkg fat ct he continuously kept calling me a fkg fat ct the, a fkg fat b**th, to fk off and fk for a good 10 minutes he then went on to threaten me saying he knows where I live and sat outside my house for nearly an hour to try and intimidate me he was still calling me these names while delivering to neighbours after it happened it was that bad I even called the police. I suffer with severe anxiety and depression and am agoraphobic, a side effect of my medication is severe weight gain and it is something that effects me greatly. I called amazon as soon as it happened and was passed from pillar to post and nothing was done I continued on at them and still nothing was done, i found out that my neighbours from both sides also phoned and reported what happened, I sent them witness statements, the recordings of the telephone call I had made that night. I received a phonecall from a so called amazon executive who was disgusted that nothing had been done and that she would take on the case. I thought that finally he would get the punishment he deserved. I received an email about a week ago saying the investigation was over but I wasn't allowed to know the outcome. I stupidly thought surely he has been sacked over this but NO I HAVE JUST SEEN HIM DELIVERING TO A NEIGHBOUR! Believe me I was in a hell of a state when it happened,the emotional damage he caused made me ill but now I'm angry,beyond angry how can he get away with what he did? any decent company would have sacked him. I'm certainly not going to let this go and I will continue to take it higher until he gets the punishment he deserves "
Ornate Hawk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Tried to make a complaint about a seller called Pretty Little Attitude (check out the name) who has caused me huge problems and wasting of time trying to get a refund. Dispatched wrong order, refunded wrong money and issued a wrong QR Code. Be aware. I am going back to using high street shops instead of Amazon. Its like the Wild West. When I told Amazon I want to complain they said will be internal and I will nto hear anything. Wow. Rubbish and no accountability to us buyers (clients). I am not using Amazon again."
Terry Godbert,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I wonder why when I want to order an item it always says FREE DELIVERY.

John king,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I am still waiting for my package and I have received zero confirmation of a delivery date. Absolute joke seeing as Amazon themselves are the courier for this package. I was told it would come on Wednesday and it did not arrive and following lengthy calls with a customer service team that where rude I was given email confirmation that the package will arrive Friday and it‚Äôs now saying Saturday and on and on. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous as the item is a bed and have had to sleep in the floor now for days seeing as Amazon have told me they just didn‚Äôt load the package on their truck. No compensation and no manners and still haven‚Äôt even got the bed.

They falsely advertised a laptop as new never state the truth Refurbished and I received an old broken laptop. I kept filing complaints and was prepared to sue them in court.

They have destroyed themselves out of greed and mismanagement.

Kam Kenth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The customer service is non existent and what very little there is - it‚Äôs shambolic. I have been trying to get a refund for 2 items. The customer service representatives are repetitive for the obvious. Out of desperation I asked to be referred to a senior management team. I was advised the highest was at ‚Äòsupervisor‚Äô level and if they could not resolve the issue there is nothing more that can be escalated. I can see from the multitude of reviews I am not the only one with issues to do with Amazon and their poor and frankly sub-satisfactory service levels. All very quick to take money but not as relentless in returning refunds. Amazon is going down hill and has lost sight of true values ie customer service. Very disappointed by Joy who advised she is a supervisor and declined to escalate further. What are the next steps legal ? Such rubbish service !

Fair and Square,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was a customer since well over a decade.Now they have lots of app bugs like math issues. A price ""increase"" from 15 to 14 bucks? Really?

DEI=Didn't earn it?Then lately I wanted to return an item not as described. It was used, not new. Well, I got a qr code to drop off at UPS. Turned out the UPS affiliate here in town doesn't accept them. Not going 50 miles spending my gas on a ""free"" return. So I contacted cs. They were helpful and promised I didn't need to return and they would refund anyway. Well, a day later they sent me a return shipping label and asked for a return again. No problem, I printed it and dropped it off. But it seems they don't even honor their own promises anymore.Product reviews won't be accepted because of always some weird excuses. As I said, I don't work for them. They SHOULD work for me as customer. But they don't!Even if I can drop it off in town I have to spend some gas to get there. So that isn't a free return!Then their packaging sucks for the most part with no good cushion. This is just the top of the iceberg. Lots of the same issues over some time.Sooo, I try to avoid them like the plague they are for me as a customer. I have a much better overall experience with other companies. And Amazon has usually way higher prices than any other company. For what? I can get most of the stuff cheaper elsewhere with an overall much better customer experience."

George Sinanis,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately Amazon is in decline and a huge one. * Ordered on 6/3 for delivery 8/3 (¬£165)* 8/3 the order marked as delivered* 8/3 i engaged with amazon's customer support to flag that i have not receive the order. I checked with neighbors but, they did not have it either.* i was told by Amazon (have it in written) that it will be delivered by Monday 10/3 or i will get a refund.* On 10/3 i went on the chat 3 times with Amazon + 2phone calls. Amazon agents terminated the chats and calls without resolving my issue. Finally managed to speak with someone that had the decency to listen to my problem, only to be told to wait again till Thursday 13/3. I refused to do that and asked for a refund. They denied it. I asked to speak with a manager, who after me insisting said that i had to wait till 11/3 (not Thursday the 13/3), which i was forced to do.* Same night (10/3) someone from a different street delivered us the package.* I opened the package to see the circular saw bare in the delivery box (not in its original box), with most of the pieces missing and the manual somewhere in the box. (I have photos!)* Same day packaged it and had to drive to the closest drop off point to return the package.Absolutely disgusting experience, with unprofessional and impolite Amazon agents. Unacceptable seller, who tried to pull a fast one. Unfortunately, Amazon is a no-go for me. I will be using them to get user ratings and reviews on items but, i will be buying from elsewhere. p.s. i bought the same circular saw from Screwfix at 5% less price than Amazon, it came in 2 days, perfectly packaged and with 2 years warranty."

The message was accompanied by a photo that did not show my door, but just a packet lying in a stair, without anything proving that it was my package or that the stair was in my building. I immediately notified Amazon that my packet had still not been delivered to my address, and, while Amazon aknowledged my message, nothing has been done by them to resolve the delivery problem. A week has now passed, and my packet has still not been delivered; nor have I been sent a replacement.Amazon's locel delivery couriers here in Edinburgh now seem to have descended to the same gutter level as those working for Evri. Do Amazon and Evri use the same local couriers?I have a medical problen that prevents me from roaming aroung the neighbourhood trying to find my packet. I need to have my deliveries made ALL THE WAY TO MY FRONT DOOR!The deplorable performance of national delivery companies is now causing considerable grief and problems for people all over the country, and it is time that the Government take action to regulate the business and eradicate the wild west mentality that characterises it at present."

yousif,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Australia has proven to be one of the worst companies when it comes to customer service and enforcing its own policies. I have been dealing with an ongoing issue regarding a purchase I made on their platform, and their complete failure to resolve it has been infuriating.	1.	Seller Violating Amazon‚Äôs Policies, and They Do NothingI purchased a worm farm composter (Order #250-4801025-8959812) and requested a basic invoice ‚Äì something that should be automatically provided. The seller ignored every request, and despite Amazon‚Äôs own A-to-Z Guarantee, they refused to take responsibility or enforce their policies.	2.	Amazon Customer Support is UselessI contacted Amazon support multiple times, and instead of helping, they kept extending deadlines and making excuses. Even after Amazon reached out to the seller, they failed to act. It‚Äôs clear that Amazon doesn‚Äôt care about enforcing its own rules, leaving customers frustrated and powerless.	3.	Avoid Amazon Australia ‚Äì They Don‚Äôt Protect BuyersIf Amazon refuses to hold sellers accountable, what‚Äôs the point of their policies? They take your money instantly, but when you need help, they disappear. Their A-to-Z Guarantee is meaningless, and their support team is completely incompetent.I will be reporting them to Consumer Affairs Victoria for failing to protect customers and uphold basic consumer rights.

And when I contacted Amazon they first told me it will be refunded within 2-3 hours. After few days nothing was still refunded so I contacted them again and I was told I need to send them my ID so they can verify my identity (why they did not want my ID when I did the purchase? and why do I need them to send my ID if my only details in the account is name and phone number - do you know how many people has the same name?).So this seems really scatchy. Dont want to send my personal secure details over an EMAIL to some 3rd party to have my details. Amazon did not even told me after what time those data will be deleted from the system. Very bad GDPR and probably even illegal. So I never received my money back. Lesson learned. Never use Amazon and rather support smaller places.

Carol,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Generally, Amazon does most things well. I do not hold them responsible for ridiculous sizing on clothes and shoes. I do, however, hold them responsible for misinforming their customers regarding Prime Benefits, mainly, Prime One-Day and Prime Two-Day delivery promises. Last night, 3/9, I ordered shirts from Amazon, all of which were eligible for Prime 1-Day or Prime 2-Day delivery per the site itself. Instead, they are all due to arrive 3/14. There appears to be a lot of bait and switch happening. Most of us count on the date when things are expected so that we can be home to make sure WE GET THEM before porch pirates strike. This is not a big ask. Amazon now appears to think we have not paid for this service. They are now reminding us of how much we have ""saved."" You are not saving $ when you are buying things. I also hold them responsible for my purchase being delivered to someone else in my neighborhood. A little over a week ago I ordered a recumbent stationary bike from Amazon - a rather expensive item. I had a 5-day window on when the item would arrive. On day 1 of the 5-day window, a neighbor came over to let me know she received a bike from Amazon that should have come to my address. I never got a delivery notice! Still have no delivery notice. It was delivered by Fed Ex. Had my neighbor been a person of ill repute, I would never have received the bike. As it stood, I had to ask someone else to haul the boxed, approx. 100 lb. awkward box down the street, thru the car port and to the back of the house. I tried to get hold of someone regarding the bad delivery, thinking (incorrectly) that someone MIGHT care. Not possible when using their AI ""customer service,"" i.e., customer shunning service.  In addition to these complaints, I have another that goes to whether or not Amazon is ethical. I ordered saffron from a known source, a company I ordered from historically. The latest saffron purchase was NOT saffron. I started researching saffron and learned that around 80% of it sold worldwide is NOT saffron. I wrote the company and told them my worry and about my research, THINKING I WAS DOING THEM A FAVOR since they cannot open every sealed tin to check for each product's authenticity. Then I wrote a review on Amazon regarding the saffron and the info I read while researching it. I was not blaming the company selling it since they were obviously ripped off. I wanted to warn customers that this latest saffron purchase was ""off."" No matter how I wrote the review, Amazon REFUSED the review. More than likely due to the seller contacting them. I have not forgiven Amazon for refusing to publish my review. Many people leave negative reviews for saffron not a far cry from my own. I know because I checked high and low to find another source. MOST saffron reviews, no matter the seller, are not good reviews. Amazon did not like any mention of the item not being genuine. I have read reviews about non-leather shoes being sold as leather, and other similar situations. How odd that my review was not allowed. How many essential reviews are never published?"

Teresa Raymond,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Prime member for many years now as well as a Kindle member too and have had a fairly up and down relationship with Amazon over time.However last week's experience really did win the prize.A delivery of multiple items totalling over ¬£100 was recorded as ""delivered to garden"" in the middle of the evening.As I was in the house and nobody had knocked on the door I wasn't best pleased.I was even less pleased with the quality of the delivery pic which was basically a black screen with a light bit and a box in the middle of the light bit.Unfortunately for me I live in a rural location with a rather large garden and after 20 minutes of searching in the dark there was still no parcel.I then spent 3 hours trying to contact customer services and was unable to get past the robots in order to speak to a human.Luckily for me the parcel was found by the lovely (and very honest) bin men the next morning at my neighbours 2 miles away on top of her bin which was due to be emptied.I am so annoyed at what a disgusting service this was and have made a promise to myself to only use them now when I absolutely have to and only order single items, no more multiple item deliveries."
hahaha02,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My account was compromised and the hacker changed the account phone number now Amazon cannot help me at all because they can only send verification to the hackers phone number. I requested to have to account closed but they won't close it either. Amazon has nothing at all set up to help user when something like this happens. I heard that Amazon had been hacked but never thought in a million years that Amazon had nothing at all in place to verify at least the Identity of the user (photo of ID/License etc.). Luckily the card on file is deactivated but this further erodes my trust in Amazon. I'm no longer a Amazon shopper and only use the firestick with a junk email address.

CMW,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazon is amazing. Don‚Äôt know how we managed shopping without it. Don‚Äôt need to run around anywhere. Can shop from the comfort of home and the item shows up at our door. If only we could run our country that way. The CEO of Amazon should run for president. 
Joe ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I thought I was finding heartworm medicine and tapeworm medicine for my dogs. I have 13 that need their heartworm prevention right now and 1 that has tapeworms right now. I do nuisance wildlife control and these are my employees. Well I ordered the medicine on Sunday and they charged my cash card $39.51 shows up pending on that card. Monday they try to run another card for $48.68 but it's declined so I changed the card to the one I thought I used not looking at the price. They run it and it's declined because I don't have enough cash on the card because of stuff like this. I tried to reach customer service by phone and chat and can't reach anyone.  Tuesday I finally get someone by chat and they tell me they will immediately ship my things out and give me $25 credit for my trouble. I will receive the stuff by Friday. Thursday I see money back on my card and thinking that they refunded my money are still going to ship my things and give me a $25 credit for my troubles.  So I saw chicken feed on sale and bought a few extra bags thus spending the money on my cash card. Saturday there's no credit on my account nor any medication at my house so I contacted them. The lady tells me she will give me the $25 credit and I should reorder my items. I said lady that's not the price I agreed to and I was told my items were being shipped right away. They wiped out all of my communications with customer service from my account, got very loud with me and told me that the $25 credit will cover the $10 price difference. I'd have been happy if they just paid the difference and shipped my stuff. Not hold up my money for a week and then tell me I have to wait another 5 days and see if there's a problem again. I've NEVER had these problems in the past but I can tell you that I will NEVER do business with them again and I will tell everyone why."
ShopaholicMum,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely terrible customer service. I have had countless parcels go missing with expensive items inside of them. They are either stolen or given to the wrong address, why hire individuals who are unable to read to do deliver jobs? its completely frustrating as they then want you to wait days and days for the delivery to ""maybe"" come and then are really hesitant to give you a refund. I am going to shut down my amazon account and go back to using ebay where the experience is alot smoother."
Youssef Samy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing to formally escalate a serious complaint regarding a refund issue with my Adidas shoe order on Amazon Egypt. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for over three years, frequently shopping for various products for myself and my family. However, this experience has been deeply frustrating and has completely eroded my trust in Amazon‚Äôs service in Egypt.Issue Summary:	‚Ä¢	I ordered an Adidas shoe, but when it arrived, the box was severely damaged, torn, and in terrible condition.	‚Ä¢	I immediately contacted Amazon Egypt, and a return request was initiated.	‚Ä¢	Since returning the item, I have faced endless delays and excuses regarding my refund.	‚Ä¢	Initially, I was asked to wait for 14 days for the refund process.	‚Ä¢	After the waiting period, I contacted customer service, and they claimed that my refund was processed. However, upon checking, I discovered that the refund request was actually rejected.	‚Ä¢	I contacted them again, and they assured me they would process it, yet it was rejected again.	‚Ä¢	Customer service repeatedly places me on hold for extended periods and then abruptly disconnects the call.	‚Ä¢	The responses I receive are vague, dismissive, and unhelpful, with constant reassurances of ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù or ‚Äúescalating the issue,‚Äù but no real action is being taken.Current Status:It has now been over 16 days, and I still have not received my refund despite the issue originating entirely from Amazon‚Äôs side. This is completely unacceptable for a company of Amazon‚Äôs size and reputation.Amazon Egypt‚Äôs customer service has been shockingly unprofessional, dismissive, and unhelpful. Their handling of this case is not only damaging Amazon‚Äôs reputation in Egypt but also causing serious concerns about service quality and accountability within your regional operations.Why This Matters:I have always trusted Amazon as my primary shopping platform. Whenever I travel to the United States or Dubai, I always choose Amazon due to its reliable service and excellent customer experience. I have purchased home essentials, electronics, car accessories, and more, and I have always recommended Amazon to friends and family.However, this experience has shattered my trust in Amazon Egypt. The stark difference in service quality and professionalism between Amazon in other countries and Egypt is deeply concerning.My Request:I demand immediate action to resolve this issue and process my refund without further delay. Additionally, I urge Amazon to investigate Amazon Egypt‚Äôs customer service failures and hold the responsible team accountable for their poor handling of customer complaints.If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate further through all possible channels, including global consumer protection agencies, social media, and international complaint platforms. I sincerely hope Amazon takes its customers‚Äô concerns seriously and acts before this situation escalates further.Order Number: 171-9826605-9059546Full Name: PeterI expect an urgent response and a resolution without further excuses or delays."

Carl D,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying, I have been an Amazon customer for years. Not every transaction has been successful, but they used to always make things right - generally hassle free.My last purchase didn't only show how far back they've gone in terms of getting the fundamentals right, but now it's clear that their CSA assistants on the online chat literally spout their script and aren't prepared to budge an iota.In a nutshell, due to what should be a simple refund back to my Amazon card balance - which they have failed on in a dramatic fashion (by lying and providing cryptic and contradicting instructions), it has become clear to me that it is time to stop funding them.My small input into the Bezos bank fund won't make any difference to them - but it will to me, and my mind will be clear.Amazon: off you pop! I'll take my business elsewhere - you have failed incredibly today."

JO,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is no longer trust worthy , gone to crap. Pay prime to get products and they cant get them to you in the timeframe when ordered. Then they play stupid games trying to convince you to keep waiting. Then after arguing with them about refunding your money you have to wait a week to10 days to get it back. ""Delayed in transit "" is a favorite excuse of Amazons they use, that one quite frequently.  I could go to depot or big box store pay a little more and come home with it and not be frustrated everytime I order something. Definitely not worth paying for prime!!!!!"

Contacted customer service multiple times after the first order, received the refund and was promised to be on top of the list for next deliveries. Never happened.

Wow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"After contacting them with a product safety/property damage concern, they gave me a huge run around and as usual just kept disconnecting me on purpose. When I finally called and got a supposed manager, that person told me he was filing an A to Z claim for me for the product I purchased having damaged my property. I was told that within 7 days I'd get an email asking me to send photos to prove the damage. Yet that never came. Eventually I got a duplicate email telling me to start the entire thing all over again, but *shocker*, nothing in that email's instructions worked. It made it literally impossible for me to do anything they said I needed to do (yet again).  I called more times and they kept disconnecting me mid conversation.  Finally I called a different manager/department and left a message with my claim # and telling them that I JUST NEED TO SEND THE PHOTO EVIDENCE.  It's been over a week and still no response.  I do not believe they ever intended to pay my claim. It was all just pulling my chain.

Q T,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"For the second time this week Amazon didn't deliver on RUSH shipping. What is really frustrating is that they mark the package delivered (with no picture) on purpose. There is a 35.00 minimum for the RUSH shipping and I always buy something a little extra so I can get my items same day per the product description. So I add an item and then they DO NOT DELIVER . Should not be allowed to mark these delivered when they KNOW they are not delivered. If it is late you can cancel, but if it is marked delivered you are SOL. I think this happens all the time. A consumer group needs to look at this or these situations need to be somehow regulated. I don't appreciate being lied to."

Wendell,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I only gave this two stars because I have been a prime member for a number of years and never really had any issues.  That being said, never buy software from these people.  I ordered Tubo Tax and for some reason there was an issue with my new credit card.  Even after I deleted this credit card, Amazon figured out how to charge me anyway.  Since I could not get it from Amazon, I ended up buying direct from Turbo Tax.  So, I contact customer service and they say no refunds on software.  I say, just cancel the order since I did not download the software.  No can do.  They say to contact Turbo Tax and give the registration number and they will refund the money.  Well, Turbo Tax refused to give me a refund.  So, I am out $72.  Besides that, it is nearly impossible to find your previously purchased software on the Amazon web page.  It's like they purposely hide it.

Oliver,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,wanted to trade in my kindle with the 20 percent discount offer. Contacted customer service and they told me they couldn't do the trade in but could give me 20 percent off anyways once I had purchased the kindle and to contact them via live chat once the order had been delivered. They sent me this in writing to my email to confirm this and said any issues contact them and they will sort it straight away. Contacted them when it arrived. They said they can do it but cant donit today as I need to wait another day. I contacted them 3 days later and they said they wasnt sure what I was told and no record of this chat but they would continue this via email so they can be sent the details via email. I sent them the email confirmation of what they had sent me. They acknowledged this and asked for more details. Order number etc so i sent that to them. Another two days had passed and no further emails. Contacted again. They asked the same question. So I again forwarded the details over and then sent it. Got an email back later to say to contact live chat to resolve this as it couldnt be done via email. Contacted them on live chat and the person said unable to do this as it needs to be done by email. What is going on? How is this so hard. Its written in black and white what was offered and the solution and they are dragging there feet and sending me round the houses for twenty percent? What‚Äôs happened to amazon. I wouldnt have ordered without the discount and I wont be ordering again from them after this shambles. They have fallen far as a company. The live chat is also so bad they dont read any of the messages and just reply clearly from a script. Issues used to be sorted immediately now it takes weeks plus.

I don't return items unless they are damaged or defective. I pay my bills on time. In this instance, I ordered a Lloyds pan that Amazon said would be delivered today. Then the order was delayed. Then the order was lost. I called and asked them to ship another pan but was told that was not possible, but my debit gift card would be credited - in 5 to 7 days. What? I'm supposed to wait 5 to 7days if I want to use this card before I can order the pan again? WTF kind of service is this? I placed the order in good faith and attempting to get Amazon customer service to simply do the right thing is proving impossible with their staff based in India. All they want to do is place me on hold and transfer me up the supervisor chain. For the love of God Amazon, just send a replacement and quit screwing around."

First are shipping related where two items were lost in transit and one item had deficient packaging where one item was lost on a delivery truck because the package ripped open. The other deficiency of Amazon is related to their security process when trying to sign on to their website. While I could easily sign on to Amazon through my phone 3 ft for my desktop computer, Amazon will not allow me to sign on through my computer They required me to change my password which I did not want to do. So I went to Amazon help, and spoke with a customer service rep who over 15 minutes explain how I could get on Amazon through my desktop computer without changing my password. After that time she realized that that wouldn't help. I explained to her that my several banks that I deal with as well as Walmart never took me through a convoluted process where I had to change my password every other week in order to access it on my desktop computer. Totally poor customer service. Not happy."

I have had an Amazon account for 10 years. On March 1st I decided to spend more and get the items delivered the next day. Because March 12th was my friend's birthday. But unfortunately they had closed the next day delivery for me. I spoke to Amazon employees on the phone more than 20 times. All 20 people gave completely different, incorrect, unprofessional, and untrue information.The interesting thing is that without my knowledge they have saved 2 accounts of mine for years. While I deleted that account in 2019. But they still had that account.When I asked them to delete my accounts so that I only had one, they rudely told me they couldn't do that.

Fortunately for the gentleman living there brought the parcel to my home!I wrote about this to Amazon but they ignored my message. I feel very distrustful of them now and so i am not sure if I will ever use them again. Have they become too big to bother? Do they not care ??
Gina,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely disgusting in all departments !I pay extra for next day delivery & in the last few months order‚Äôs  have been cancelled or delayed & not just buy a day or too ! It‚Äôs been almost every order I have placed over last month or more !Also having to spend over ¬£20 to get next day delivery is a joke it takes your money & dose not come next day. Then have to wait 3/4 days for a refund. Will be shopping elsewhere from now on !!!! 
Andr√© L.A.C Bittencourt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is not the same anymore. Products are delivered in bad shape, with scratches, and it is not really fast anymore. On top of that, their core values and belief, approximation to Trump adminstration, lack of integral leadership is not a match more me anymore. "
Paul Neve,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Refused to accept an item for return within the month, even though in the order itself it says I gave up to 12th March, today is 4th. Amazon product, sold by Amazon, on Amazon system.  Clearly they protect themselves.  Never again"
Kelvin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been dealing with Amazon UK for 4 months regarding a faulty Hisense washer dryer, and the experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.From the start, the appliance was faulty, and I followed Amazon‚Äôs process by requesting a repair. 4 times, I have been booked for a repair, and each time, nothing happened‚Äîno technician came, no one contacted me, and the issue remained unresolved.After all these failed repair attempts, Hisense themselves approved a refund and provided me with a refund code to give to Amazon. However, despite having manufacturer approval, Amazon has refused to process my refund and insists on booking yet another repair.On top of this, most of the customer service representatives have been rude and unhelpful. Many times, they abruptly end chats or calls on me when I push for answers. Instead of helping me, they ignore my concerns and offer no real solutions.Under the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, if a product is faulty and repairs have repeatedly failed, I have the right to reject the product and receive a full refund. Yet Amazon continues to ignore my rights and drag this issue out instead of providing a fair resolution.I have now escalated this to Citizens Advice and Trading Standards, and I am considering further action. I would strongly warn anyone against purchasing expensive appliances from Amazon, as they clearly do not respect consumer rights and will make it as difficult as possible for you to get a refund, even when it is justified.Amazon UK, I demand that you stop delaying and process my refund immediately!"

Demand and require just to sell on their site.Yes it's convenient. I'm done with done with convenience.

Alma,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I paid for a laptop which I really needed in Amazon Spain. Hours after, they changed the price to 130 euros less. It is so unfair, I needed to use this laptop and now I have to return it, because it is not normal. Customer service and employees have been the less kind beings I have met in a while, acting passive-agressively and not offering other solutions than RETURNING the product and buying it again. Where are those eco policies you boast of, Amazon? Unnecessary petrol, packaging and much more... Dissapointing. I have been their regular customer for about ten years. Your loyalty will not be compensated in a monster company like this, which only cares about money and which employees are not happy. "

Mary,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what item I received. I purchased Raman blazing hot soup chili flavor. First I ordered blazing hot chili flavor in Feb. from one vender. I don't know if I even received it. According to Amazon tracking I did. If I had the receipt or packing list I could confirm that. but all I have ia the electronic receipt which can be send regardless of delivery. But then I ordered shrimp. I received fiery beef. That vender did send the correct item, shrimp. Again no packing list.But my point is All orders NEVER have a packing list or a receipt in the box so I don't know what I got from which vendor.  And I paid for it all. I know they want to get the order out fast but what good does it do if it's the wrong item? I don't do prime. I can wait for a time as long as the order is correct.And even if I wanted to, I can't send it back because it's food. I'm so confused. I don't think I'll be purchasing from Amazon for some time or even ever again. "

Litsa Savva,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Really disappointing. I've been buying from Amazon for years but this year, it appears, they have changed their policy when it comes to non delivery of goods.  Admittedy this is the first time an order was not delivered.  I ordered 3 products on 3 seperate orders, they delivered 1 (the cheapest one) however, driver recorded all 3 as having been delivered.  Customer Service looked at their system and said its been recorded as delivered so there is nothing they can do.  They refused to look into what may have gone wrong and refused a refund.  For an organisation of this size and stature I would have expected a better service.  I am still fighting for my money back."

Bear in mind that they have to drive through my front door to get out of the park. I been complaining for almost 5 months. They just don‚Äôt care anymore. They give me excuses after excuses and even though my delivery instructions even has my contact number, they just don‚Äôt care to read them. I can‚Äôt walk at the moment to the reception so I have to wait for someone walking by and ask them to pick my post for me. Worst customer service I have experienced in a very long time.

R.U ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've been shopping on and off with Amazon for some time, but my recent experience has been extremely disappointing. I ordered multiple items, and upon opening the box, I realized one item was missing. I reached out to customer service via chat, and the agent assured me a refund would be processed‚Äîsimple enough, or so I thought.Later that day, I received an email stating that, after an ""investigation,"" Amazon found I had opened similar cases on ""numerous accounts."" This is completely false‚ÄîI only have one Amazon account, and my order history shows no record of missing, broken, or undelivered items. At most, this is the second time something has gone missing, yet they used this as an excuse to deny my refund.It's frustrating to be treated as if I‚Äôm making false claims when I‚Äôm simply asking for what I paid for. Amazon‚Äôs customer service has seriously gone downhill, and this experience has left a bad taste. If this is how they now handle genuine customer concerns, I may take my business elsewhere. A real shame."
BJC,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Amazon sales were once the best but so many now that should be next day delivery are not. They say they have delivered but have not.

YY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Last December, I started to notice that someone else's order history was showing up in my account. It's been consistent with regular purchases at the same store (Whole Foods). I contacted the customer service the first time.  The agent promised that this issue would be fixed by engineering within a week.  I asked for a reference number but was told he couldn't provide me one, but promised again that this issue would be fixed.  I trusted him but 5 weeks later, the other person's orders continued to pop up in my account history. So I contacted customer service again.  I got the exact same response from another agent, and then I insisted that either I be given a reference number or I'd like to talk to a manager.  I was connected to a manager, and he gave me the same promise again, except that the issue will be fixed within 24 hours.  Ok, I trusted him again, and also made it clear that this is a crucial problem because it means Amazon is having a data privacy issue for weeks while it's the biggest consumer website with billions of customers around the world. It was positive first as the other person's order history disappeared from my account very quickly. I tried to forget my concerns for a few weeks and now only found out that it came back again.  Looks like what happened was that engineering removed the other person's order history from my account, but likely never addressed the root cause and hence, once the other person started to order again, the record started to show up in my account. This is extremely concerning, not only because my data could have been leaked to other users, but also because seems that Amazon is not really taking user privacy seriously. "
Jackie McDonald Vasquez,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon was my favorite place to shop until 12/12/24. Amazon was the best place to shop for these 3 girls that I buy Christmas and birthdays for. until I was done wrong by Amazon this past December. As I have done for several years now I ordered my friends granddaughter a gift card for her birthday on December 12, 2024.I ordered a $50 gift card and while I was on line ordering and I pushed to complete the sale a message comes up that the order had been canceled because my card had declined.  My card had not declined because I checked my balance before ordering the gift card. I closed the sale and went back to my bank on line and verified my balance was correct. I then went back to Amazon.com to reorder the gift card. When I ordered I had no trouble getting the gift card to go through. Now this all happened within 15 minutes. I‚Äôm still thinking I had just ordered the second transaction thinking that, as Amazon said that order had been canceled. A few days later I saw where my card had been charged and the first order did go through. I called Amazon, I sent several emails and I was totally ignored. Someone told me a phone number how to speak to that department. I called and they told me I would hear back from them within 24 hours. That did not happen. I called that number back and the lady who answered had very broken English I could hardly understand her. I explained again and she says that Amazon doesn‚Äôt give refunds on gift cards. I explained again that I was double billed and she absolutely said to me, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt give refunds on gift cards now if you can‚Äôt accept that I will hang up on you.‚Äù She proceeded and hung up. I was never treated that way by Amazon in all of the years I shopped with them, I was highly insulted.  I chose to go through my bank and they gave me my $50 dollars back. A month later, yesterday, I got a letter from my bank Amazon charged my bank again. My bank believed Amazon that it was all the same gift cards and gave them the $50 when they requested it.  I notified the little girls grandma to go ahead and get the second $50 and we would figure out how to handle it. Too late, Amazon has already taken that gift card and put 3 service charges and now has depleted the entire card except $3.33. All I want is my entire $50‚Äôs back in the same was I paid for it‚Ä¶Back on my debit card"
Dom,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Terrible service. Bought a laptop at a great discount. Turns out the third party seller is a scammer and tried to steal my money by cancelling my order and lying to get me to order somewhere else. Amazon Customer Support then told me that I should order a new laptop from Amazon as the seller and they will refund the price difference. Two agents said the price difference will be refunded. When it came to the refund, I was refused any help. So now I'm returning the full item, being almost scammed and now also tricked by Amazon itself. Truly shocking they're allowing scammers on their site as well as have their agents spread false information and promises."

Arbind Chaurasia,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years, mainly because of their easy return policy. We order a lot of products from them, and whenever something was defective or unsuitable, returning it was never an issue.However, Amazon seems to be taking advantage of our trust now. Recently, I ordered a dustbin, assuming‚Äîlike always‚Äîthat if there was any issue, I could return it. But when I tried to initiate a return, I was shocked to see that it was a ""non-returnable"" item.Amazon conveniently changed its policy overnight and claimed that it was mentioned on the website. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwhen people shop online, they focus on product images, descriptions, and price. No one checks the return policy for every single item, especially from a platform known for hassle-free returns!This feels like a fraudulent and deceptive practice. If Amazon is changing its policies, they need to clearly highlight return restrictions in a way that customers can‚Äôt miss. Tricking loyal customers like this is absolutely unacceptable!"
Paul Stroud,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered an Item.  After 6 days it had not arrived.  When went through the rigmarole of contacting Amazon I spoke to an agent who was I like a robot.

The next day I received notification that I would receive a refund, This was never mentioned during the telephone.  If I wanted money I would not have bothered ordering in the first place!"

Diego Ramalhete,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I specifically paid for next day delivery on an expensive item because I wasn‚Äôt available any other days due to work, I have been waiting at home for the parcel only to find out at around 19:00, which is late enough, that it won‚Äôt be able to be delivered, not only have I had to reschedule my parcel due to Amazon‚Äôs incompetence or lack of tracking with their couriers and they have made no progress on refunding me the ‚ÄúNEXT DAY‚Äù delivery charge. I‚Äôm now forced to contact customer service via telephone during THEIR opening hours to claim a refund for the next day delivery fee that they now owe me. I would like to point out that I ordered 3 items at the same time and 2 of them got delivered in time however by some odd chance the expensive one was the one that wasn‚Äôt delivered at the same time? Seems VERY VERY suspicious that the expensive one suddenly is delayed. Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had issues with Amazon as I had previously ordered a different expensive item along side other items and that one just straight up got stolen by one of their delivery drivers or employees. Amazons advice at the time was to contact my local police and get a police report to then raise it with Amazon as proof and claim the refund. Which I thought was absolutely absurd, why should I have to contact MY police and report something due to Amazons incompetence in tracking parcels?? Nevertheless I ended up getting my money back however it did take 5 working days so I wasn‚Äôt able to reorder the item again until a week later, and further more after the whole investigation finished Amazon then proceeded to send me an email accusing me of SCAMMING them for claiming an item that was missing, warning me that ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù was present on my account because I claimed a refund more than 3 times even though that was my first time claiming a refund!! Safe to say if you‚Äôre looking to get anything expensive from Amazon think twice find a different online retailer they don‚Äôt seem to care at all about customers anymore. Safe to say I‚Äôm gladly cancelling my annual Amazon prime subscription, not really bothered too much about this since most good shows on Amazon prime you have to pay for anyway and they seem to be shoving adverts down your throat despite you paying them to use their streaming service (which is another issue in on itself), I will not be ordering from them ever again I think Amazon at the moment is very comparable to eBay in terms of how bad it is to order from them and I will be deleting my account as well as selling my Alexa‚Äôs. The less money you pump into this company the better!! STAY AWAY"
Hayley Elizoebeth Ryn'Mika Gre,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I just found out that Amazon has been stealing my money. I'm autistic and if things don't fit or work as said, I send them back. I'm also far too honest and trusting and ""na√Øve"" as people say. I kept a pair of water shoes which I use around the house, that are bigger than the last pair of the same size and brand. I kept them because I didn't just try them on, I got a fair amount of use out of them. They aren't SAFE to use because they're too large and I keep rolling my ankles . . . but I didn't have money to buy new ones to replace them and my old ones were literally falling apart. So yesterday I found out that Order #112-9876360-7920208 had the refund taken back.I think it was for the ice cream machine. It didn't work even after leaving the tub in the freezer for multiple days, with the window open to the freezing outside, and everything else I could think of.I returned it. My mom did technically but she DID return it. The return went through. I checked and it says they still haven't received it. That's not on me. I don't trust UPS but it was the only option I had. I mean literally I didn't have any other options AVAILABLE.This is on AMAZON NOT ME!!This is so not fair and I . . . like I said, I'm autistic. I'm too trusting and whatever everyone else says. On top of that I know I'm not good with money but I'm also good at numbers. I thought I wasn't because all my money kept disappearing. I realize now they've been stealing my money.I have no idea how long this has been going on but it finally makes sense why I always buy stuff, try to keep at least $100 in reserve, and it always goes missing without me spending it. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE!!! But when my money goes missing without me spending it, that's when I mean. This time I had gotten down to $300 from $644 - yes I'm on disability that's all I get each month. So I had bought a power supply because my computer constantly blue screens and I thought that might fix it. That was $70? Bought something else that was $70 and $70 in groceries. I don't have a fixation with that number it's just how it happened to be. This isn't exact, they weren't exactly but I'm not looking it all up . . .I had $40 in Amazon subscription items.Youtube Premium which I got a free 3 month sub for in January decided to charge me $15.01 despite that I cancelled the auto renew as soon as I got the free trial thing - and now I can't cancel it again, it says it's not an available thing or something. So yeah I'm not 100% great with the exact number of money but I know about what I have saved each month.I bought some other small objects and treated myself to $20 in fast food . . . for fries, burger, and a shake o_o THINGS COST TOO MUCH!!?? :<I was down to about $320. I still had to get my art printed for the art show and a frame for it, I figured about $100. I treated myself again this time with two pairs of hair sticks and some eye liner. Still closer to $300 than $200. I went to the same fast food place, got another shake - thin mint~ , and a small burger and a drink.A bit closer to $200 and I started to get nervous so I stopped spending. That was Thursday.The past couple days I saw my account go down to $102, and then $0 with $4 from my overdraw. I checked and stopped at the order I saw and linked. They stole my money. They did it twice I'm sure. I'm lucky, my mom loves my art and is proud of me and excited to see it in an art show so she is going Monday to pay for the print and frame and take it to the location. Anyway, I'm disabled. I would go through and audit my account and see which refunds they've refused to process but it's a few things that make it very difficult for me to do - It's exhausting to even think about and I have CFS so actually doing it is going to be a nightmare. I have sever anxiety and I used to have sever clinical depression which I don't want to relapse into by getting despaired by this heinousness. There's more too I just can't think. Even typing this was exhausting in so many ways."

Honest review,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The ""burden of proof"" now lies with the customer... When items/products aren't delivered or vanish or are stolen or lost in the machine, you must provide your government issued ID to substantiate account holder verification in order for Amazon to decide whether or not to refund you on something you paid for and didn't receive... And then, you have to wait 3 days before YOU call THEM and THEY determine whether or not you've received the products that you didn't receive! We no longer as consumers have any power to fight or protest with our checkbooks. And there are NO consumer protections! The FTC is MIA! The hyperbureaucracy is real.

R Fitzgerald,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Cost. Quality. Service. Over the last 2 years we have seen a very positive focus on customer service. Amazon has made some excellent changes in response to complaints and FTC settlements. The new business model have caused us to increase our purchase activity by 500%. We are considering changing our relationship from Amazon business customer to Amazon Prime. The new contact feature that allowed me to speak with Sarah in customer service at 6:30AM PT is excellent. She handled every question and request professionally and demonstrated excellent listening skills. Honest answers. We have learned how to first sort our purchase request for the best Amazon experience. Only product and sellers with a 4+review over time by volume. Don't show me sellers with high return rates. The new return procedures using UPS drop off are stunning fast and easy. Most important to us is Amazon has changed their arrogant pr-select policy. The still pre-fill the drop off place for returns which is irritating. But we have learned to be very careful in our ordering. We have been very critical of Amazon in the past. We believe we have an obligation to tell them they are getting it right and being a more friendly seller.

Steve London,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon are Thieves and liars! I cannot believe I am writing this review after 15 years as a customer. I bought a phone from Amazon.com while in Canada. BEFORE purchasing, I asked SPECIFICALLY can I get the duties and delivery charges waived BEFORE purchasing.  I was told YES THREE Times in WRITING in chat... and also confirmed that I get Amazon's 30 day guarantee and Free return policy back to the US if I don't like the phone!  I simply had to phone in once the phone arrived and ask for the refund. Today the phone arrived and I got on Chat with Amazon. Despite the fact Amazon agrees I was promised the above in writing 3 times BEFORE purchasing they REFUSED to honor it. I reminded them they have a LEGAL Obligation to honor their promise to me (and especially a moral promise to a very loyal, long term customer). Amazon (India customer service) still REFUSED  basically telling me it was MY fault for trusting Amazon! I was stunned and 4 more times contacted Amazon to fix this... and refused each time for the same reason and then, incredibly, I was WAS HUNG UP/logged off on 4 Times!  On the last call they then told me not only do I not get the $60 refund I was promised, I would also have to pay the return postage of $70 USD if I return the phone back to the USA (another promise by Amazon broken)!!!!  I just cannot believe how I have been treated by Amazon's Indian customer service agents-- rude, nasty, arrogant and cold hearted.  I am hung up on???????

When tried to chat to them many times they said to process the refund can take 60days, but close the chat so quickly that I can't read what they aswered. Today around 80-90days later as the transacton still has not been cancelled I tried to ask them to cancel the transaction, same answer but without the 60days and closed the chat that quickly it is impossible to read what the agent wrote, like if I would be a bad person, however I just returned a single item to them using my own postage.

Ben Davis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I think I was one of the first to actually ""subscribe"" to Amazon. None of my friends knew about it at the time. I'm sorry that I had to go, but sticking with any business that supports fascism in any way is a deal breaker. It is true that their customer service has gone WAY downhill too. Not getting deliveries on time was beginning to be an issue.This hurts! We had a few jokes in my house about how often and how much I bought, but it was SO convenient for me as I work full time and stopping at the store isn't my favorite thing to do. Oh well, unfortunately, I will inconvenience myself. Funny thing is, I started ordering from Target when I first dumped my Amazon membership and then I had to leave them too! Costco is great though and I probably would have never known if my conscience hadn't made me walk away from corporations that support a wanna be dictator. What a sad world we live in. I hope Bezos suffers greatly for his part in it."

Anne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE on December 27, 2024, with an estimated delivery date of January 11. By January 8, it still hadn‚Äôt shipped. After struggling to contact Amazon, I was assured they would ""sort it out""‚Äîwhich meant delaying my order by over two weeks to January 27, with no explanation or notification (after multiple attempts at ascertaining the cause of the delay).I needed this tablet for an important exam, and I specifically chose it based on the estimated delivery date. Repeated attempts to get real answers led to the same generic response: ""Sorry for the delay, but there‚Äôs nothing we can do."" When I asked to escalate the issue, I was told it was ""above my limitations"" and the chat was closed.¬†Amazon promised a shipping refund in February, but after another tedious attempt to contact them in Feb, I was told that was incorrect and¬†Amazon ""does not offer refunds.""¬†How can you promise a refund and then tell me you don't do refunds?This experience has been frustrating beyond words. Amazon lacks transparency, has poor customer service, and makes it nearly impossible to resolve basic issues. If you need something on time, don‚Äôt trust their estimated delivery dates. Their customer support is feels like it is designed to wear you down, and they seem to thrive on making complaints so difficult that people give up. Is that why you don't really see negative reviews? It is so difficult to leave one? Shall we rather stick to Takealot or even the cheaper new e-commerce companies?"

Eximio,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit I appreciate 1 day delivery.  I also have not had problems returning items.  I don't return a huge amount of orders, but with electronics, if the items does not work perfectly or exactly match the product description, I take it back.  However, what I am noticing now is that other retailers are getting much better and Amazon is not actually keeping up, after 2 decades of being way out in front.  The other thing I am noticing is that I am finding a lot of value in other retailers that have a narrower product range, but it's curated and they carry only what they recommend to their customers, as opposed to hundreds of options on Amazon.The other thing I am noticing is that other retailers are now doing SAME DAY delivery, delivery within 3-4 hours, without a delivery charge and WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR A MEMBERSHIP.  Amazon Prime is such a rip-off. It's become almost like extortion, forcing us to pay for things we don't want (like their lousy streaming services) just so we can get 1 or 2 day delivery.For instance, I was recently shopping for a lamp.  Amazon had probably hundreds of options.  I stopped looking after about 30.  They seemed to all be from China and their product descriptions were written in poor English.  None of them matched what I was looking for.  In frustration, I decided to check Home Depot's website just to see if they had anything I liked.  I assumed that if they did, I'd have to drive there, which I did not really want to do.  Well, Home Depot had something that met about 90% of what I wanted.  The items roughly similar were about the same price on Amazon, but when I say ""roughly similar"" I mean they were not close enough to what I wanted.As I was looking at the product on Home Depot, I noticed the listing noted that it was in inventory in the store closest to me, and that they would DELIVER IN 3 HOURS if I placed the order on their web site.  So, I did.  Sure enough, it was delivered well within 3 hours.  I had the light up and running that same day.  It was great!In the past, I would just search on Amazon and usually order from them assuming it would be the best price and I'd get it in a day and that was the best I could get.  Now, I know that I should check more than just Amazon.  I might be able to get a product that better matches what I'm looking for, with good quality, at a price that is competitive, and with free same day delivery.  Now I will always check Home Depot in that category.  And I guess Best Buy for electronics .... and I'll discover others.  If Home Depot is doing same day delivery, many other retailers are probably using the same service that handles that (I think it's a UPS subsidiary).  I will not just check Amazon and reflexively place an order with them.I don't think that Home Depot has good customer service.  But Amazon is even worse!  They make it nearly impossible to reach a live human customer service representative.  The other retailers have finally figured out how to fight back and regain market share.  That's good for consumers!  Sorry Amazon, but you are only as good as the last time I searched your e-commerce site.  You are only as good as your last delivery.  Your people in corporate tend to be quite arrogant.  I once loved you.  Now I'm just lukewarm about you and willing to play the field.  You have lost your luster.  "

The items are vital including overcounter meds, help items for elders and things that make me happy to do such as gifts to others. The delivery folk are wonderful as I have come to know them. It doesn't matter how small or large the items are, I get them almost the next day and being a Prime member, enjoy very much their movies, many that are international.

They DO NOT WANT to verify my acct via Amazon Prime acct but instead want me to down load a separate Third party App to my phone to verify my details. Further, the App wants to access my phone operating features. How silly. Every other utility such as cell phone, cable, electric ,etc can do this while on the phone. AMAZON WANTS ME TO SHARE MY PERSONAL INFO TO A THIRD PARTY CHINESE APP For CUSTOMER SERVICE people in a third world country. If any news agency or interested party wants to verify my review, I recorded my conversation with Amazon customer service. My issue was not resolved as they hung up on me.

Stacey Norman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a product from a another company, they used Amazon Shipping to deliver my package. The order was made Feb. 15, the package was picked up on the 19th. As of 5 days ago, the package had left a facility that is a little under 50 miles from the delivery destination. It would be safe to say that I haven't recieved the package yet. I just got off the phone with customer service and I was told, by someone who could barely speak English, that if my package hasn't been recieved and it is passed the delivery date stated that my package would not be arriving, at all, and I needed to contact the seller for a full refund. I have never once had a problem ordering or receiving  orders from Amazon. I actually think they are really great but Amazon Shipping as a delivery service leaves much to be desired. That goes for  customer service also. The guy never even offered his name so there is no way to make a complaint against him personally. I do know that the next time I pay $10 for s&h I'll make sure the company doesn't use Amazon Shipping as their delivery service and, if so, I'll order elsewhere!"

Tiffani Treniece,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased an adjustable desk from Amazon, and while the desk itself works fine, the power adapter it came with is defective‚Äîit emits a constant noise that makes it difficult to use. Instead of offering a reasonable solution, Amazon has refused to replace the adapter, issue a partial refund for the defective part, or allow me to use my $20 promotional credit on a compatible replacement.Returning the entire desk is unreasonable. UPS did not follow my delivery instructions, so I had to carry the heavy desk up 19 steps alone. Now Amazon expects me to disassemble it, repackage it, and return it, all because they won‚Äôt issue a refund or send a replacement adapter.The $20 credit is useless because Amazon does not sell the adapter I need. I‚Äôve requested a partial refund for the adapter, a replacement, or the ability to use my credit on a third-party seller, but Amazon refuses.Amazon has been accused of manipulative business practices by the FTC, and this is another example of poor customer service.

Nadia Raich,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In an era where convenience often outweighs conscious consumerism, Amazon's transformation into an increasingly automated and impersonal system raises important ethical and societal concerns. The rise of artificial intelligence and algorithm-driven commerce threatens to erode the human connections that once defined trade, replacing local businesses with faceless transactions and monopolizing markets in ways that leave little room for independent sellers to thrive. If we continue down this path, we risk a future where corporations dictate not just what we buy, but how we live‚Äîshaping our habits, values, and even our sense of community. To newer generations, the lesson is clear: do not mistake efficiency for progress. True progress comes from supporting one another, fostering human relationships, and making mindful choices that preserve the richness of local economies and culture. A world dominated by automation and profit-driven giants is not inevitable‚Äîit is the result of collective choices. "

Besides that being an honest mistake, it isn't the reason why I contacted them for them to stop blocking me from making reviews. It's the playing dumb that is insulting and gaslighting. I keep getting an error message that I can't write reviews for anything I buy on Amazon, this just started happening a month ago. Amazon customer service sends the concern to a department known as ""amazon communities."" Amazon communities pretends not to even know why I needed help and after explaining in detail the issue of them blocking me from leaving reviews they lie and say they can't help me just because they can't ""duplicate the issue"". I have been a customer for many years and this just started happening very recently. This department is stealing money from amazon while they pretend they are doing work.

When I asked why this was happening, they started writing me some nonsense, and because I kept demanding an answer, they simply disconnected the chat with me. This is complete disrespect.

Amazon is not trust worthy to me anymore. I sent pictures to a customer service representative . I can wait for yall to to another part out because yall need the one yall sent first. I gave yall my money trusting yall to send me the right part and yall didnt. The customer gets hurt because Amazon's mistake. 
Jade,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have had an absolutely terrible experience with Amazon this week and I feel compelled to share my frustration and extreme disappointment.I placed an order for an Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Silicone Case but instead, I received an iPhone 14 Pro Max Silicone Case‚Äîin the wrong colour‚Äîand it was packed inside an iPhone 6 Pro Max box, I contacted Amazon and they apologised and refunded. This is still inconvenient as I now need to source another and wait for delivery. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, on the day before, I ordered an Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB) for ¬£1,352.07 from Amazon Resale. The phone was described as Used, Like New. Three days later, I received my package, I opened it to find an umbrella and a packet of drill attachments instead of my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Amazon packaging was sealed when it arrived so I can only assume this was done inside their own warehouse. I immediately contacted Amazon Customer Service, who asked me to send photos of what I received. But how does sending a picture of an umbrella and drill bits help verify that I was supposed to receive an iPhone 16 Pro Max? Their response didn‚Äôt instil much confidence. I have done what they have asked and now I must sit back and wait. This is now the second time this week Amazon Resale have not sent the correct items and I can‚Äôt help but question who is packing these orders. Is there CCTV in the warehouse? Will there be an investigation? At this point, I don‚Äôt feel I can trust the fulfillment process at Amazon anymore.I hope Amazon takes these issues seriously because this is completely unacceptable."
Bryan Burns,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was ""rewarded"" 2 free audio books so I accepted the offer without reading all the fine print that did inform me that I would be billed for audio books starting next month. I went to my subscriptions to try to get rid of audio books and found that I had 5 other subscriptions that Amazon was billing me monthly for. When I looked at my bank statements in the last few years, I assumed it was purchases from Amazon since I was buying something pretty often. When you think you're buying a one time event like a movie, oh no, you're gonna be billed every month for something that you are unaware of. Looking for a Amazon replacement now. Con artists. "
Mark Braybrook,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is becoming worse by the day. First, they raised the free delivery threshold to ¬£35, making it harder to get free shipping without spending more. But the worst part is Prime Video‚Äîdespite already paying for a subscription, they‚Äôve now added ads unless you pay even more to remove them.The experience feels more like a cash grab than a service. If I‚Äôm already paying for Prime, I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay extra just to watch without ads. The quality of the TV content isn‚Äôt even great anymore. Amazon used to be better, but now it‚Äôs just about making more money"
Vladislav Danchev,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Twice I ordered from Amazon, and twice it was a complete disaster and a waste of time. I chose same-day delivery, but the item never arrived. They then promised it would come the next day, on Sunday‚Äîfair enough. But Sunday came and went, and instead of delivering, they just processed a refund. Now I have to wait 5 to 7 days to get my money back. Thanks, Amazon, for holding onto my money and wasting my time! To make matters worse, the item was meant to be a gift, so I had to scramble and buy it elsewhere. Absolutely awful service!"

Mike Gosha,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I purchase a tremendous amount of products from Amazon. Recently I have experienced Amazon not backing their delivery timeline. I just purchased a $3200 outdoor building from them and, at the last minute, it gets bumped back days. I took off from work for the delivery... Now I lost a days pay. If this is not enough, the tools I needed to do the job, have now been bumped four days back, citing bad weather. Well, the problem with this is, that the depot where my tools are being held is a 15 minute ride from my house. No bad weather whatsoever! I spoke with Amazon and they stated that they will ""take care of the situation"". They won't. These are just the most recent incidents involving Amazon. Bottom line: Conduct business with them, BUT, do not trust them. They can't mess with the product itself, but they will ship when it is advantageous to them, not you, the customer."

St√©phanie Olive,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to purchase over 10K/ year on Amazon. Not anymore!!First, theire subscribe & Save is a great idea but they are always late if the orders arrived at all. Once those orders are returned to the shipper because Amazon will just package anything together with no protection and they are damaged upon shipping. Well, you call Customer service and they are no help at shipping back the order. Now, you have to re-order yourself and of course since a month or more have passed the price is substantially more. The Customer rep then lie to you and tell you they will refund the price difference. Well, they won't. You call twice and they give you the work around (technical issue, another lie) and finally a manager very hostile will tell you: Well, you got refunded for the order you didn't receive, end of the call and hang up on you. Among other things in this order, I overpaid $10 for a face cream that I wouldn't have EVER purchased if I was not lied to begin with. Is it too hard to expect that they honor they initial contract that was for $15, now they pocket $25 a week later because they failed at delivering the product? REALLY?? And I am hang up on by JENNIFER for explaining this. You won't see me back. Took me 30 mins to cancel all my subscribed and save. They are unethical and RUDE."
Mr Smith,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Five out of my last eight orders have either been days late or didn't turn up at all. No info from Amazon about what's going on. It's nearly impossible to get through the impenetrable bots and 'help' pages to speak to a customer service agent. When you do finally find a human being they apologise a hundred times, give the wrong information and make promises that never come to fruition. Then having had your time completely wasted and ending up with nothing it takes weeks to get your money back.I've had little complaint with the company for years but this last three or four months they've gone to pot. I don't trust them any more so I don't use them and that means I cannot justify paying for Prime membership. So it's bye bye Amazon."

JVinz,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I'm shocked to see Amazon rated so low (makes me wonder about some people's motivations).  Over a roughly 10 year period, I've experience nothing but good things from them.  On the occasions when there have been problems with an order, I'm always either refunded or had the item replaced promptly.  I even had one instance where I thought a pretty expensive item was defective.  Instead of having me go through the trouble of sending it back, they just replaced it.  I was later able to fix the first item I received as it was just a case of a loose wire.  I still feel a little guilty about that but it was an honest mistake.  From their prompt deliveries to their Prime Video services, Amazon has honestly improved my shopping and entertainment experience.  Thanks, Amazon.  Here's to 10 more happy years!"

Despite their commitment to a virtual interview on 05/02/2025, they failed to uphold it and have since completely ignored all correspondence for over 90 days.This is not just incompetence‚ÄîAmazon has breached every law in the book regarding fair trading, contract law, and seller rights. They have refused to engage, provide a resolution, or even acknowledge the damage they have caused.To make matters worse, I have had to grieve the deaths of both my son and father within the last 12 months, and Amazon‚Äôs sheer lack of professionalism, negligence, and refusal to return my earnings has only worsened my suffering. Their actions have forced me into counseling due to the additional stress and financial hardship‚Äîa situation entirely avoidable if they simply honored their legal obligations.This is my money. Amazon has taken it fraudulently and refused to acknowledge their wrongdoing.

I was shocked and appalled by what I found.It turns out that Amazon, despite having many brilliant items on their website, also stock some of the worst products ever known to mankind.

I returned an item using Amazon‚Äôs QR code at Staples, where it was scanned and accepted.

I followed all return instructions, but now Amazon is refusing to issue my refund. Instead of holding me responsible, Amazon should investigate the issue with Staples and the carrier, who are involved in the return process.A company of Amazon‚Äôs size and reputation should stand by its policies and customers, but this experience has made me question their reliability. If Amazon cannot handle basic refunds fairly, how can customers trust them?I am sharing my experience to warn others‚Äîbe cautious when making purchases, as Amazon may not honor their refund commitments, even when you follow all their return steps."

Zarak,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Dear Amazon Support,I recently submitted a review for a product I purchased on Amazon, providing honest feedback about my experience, including the delivery time. However, I received a notification stating that my review was rejected. I would like to understand the reason for this rejection, as my review was based on facts and my actual experience as a customer.I believe that the purpose of reviews is to offer transparency to other customers and help the company improve its services. If I am not allowed to mention an important aspect of the purchase, such as delayed delivery, then the feedback process becomes limited and less useful.   They say there's software that rejects some words, but why did the programmer of this software include non-offensive words like ""delivery""? I wonder if he will have to go back to school to learn that the word ""delivery"" doesn't offend anyone, If Amazon wants to manipulate our feedback, why does it ask us for our opinion? It would be better to automate all reviews to five stars."

Donna Woodley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Order by Lauren Woodley  All Amazon knows how to do is take your money. They don't take accountability for their mistakes. And I want to put on blast the EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE by these Supervisors - Cassie, Daniella and Alex.  Daniella and Alex both hung up on me on separate calls - all they kept saying was there was nothing that they could do.  I placed a large order for $76 and my form of payment was a Visa giftcard. The order went through.  After a few days, I learned that the order went to a Saved Form of payment on my account which was an actual credit card (not the giftcard that I used). This was my mom's credit card. No one contacted me about this change. This was my mom's credit card. When I called in initially and spoke to Cassie, she stated that she could not fix it by putting the order charge back onto my Visa giftcard.  But she did say that Amazon.com would issue a refund credit for the order without me returning any items.  All 3 of the Supervisors could find no record of Amazon.com notifying me when they decided to charge another form of payment. They did say it should have been done.  I expected the refund credit that Cassie spoke about in a timely manner. After 10 days with no refund on my mom's credit card I called again and spoke to both Daniella and Alex (separate calls). They both hung up on me when all I was trying to do was have Amazon.com follow through on the refund credit or change the Form of payment. They were no help at all and frankly just rude.  Cassie did not follow through with the credit and Daniella and Alex did nothing but say ""Return the items for a refund"".  For some items I did not have the packaging anymore to return the items (I was expecting a refund credit as Cassie was handling).  Daniella and Alex had no response to me saying I was missing packaging after all this time.  Everyone out there, stop using Amazon.com and buy elsewhere.  This is a terrible company to use. I would give them 0 stars if I could."

Tracy Smyth,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Amazon prime is brilliant I probably have 4-5 deliveries a week however their drivers are awful and rude most are agency staff nowI have safe place instructions on my account yet the drivers continue to dump parcels in my doorstep in all weathers when not in and when I am in they don‚Äôt even wait for me to answer the door When confronted they are always rude Such a shame as Amazon itself is a great company and their customer services deal with issues and complaints very quickly and they have a great chat system Amazon your drivers are letting you down! 
Redell Johnson,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I have been Prime Customer for over 5 years now and the level of service, especially shipping has gotten consistently worse.  First, you now have to pay for expedited shipping and even then you still don't get the package as promised.  I get that the weather plays a factor in delivery, but today is a bright sunny day and now I'm being told that my package that was  ordered on 2/14 and was supposed to be delivered on 2/18 will now be delivered on 2/20!  Unacceptable."

Julie Carter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This company has gone down hill and is shady. Had  two recent experiences. One involving a company called Affirm that handles any payment plans for Amazon. Had to return an item but didn't receive refund for 4 weeks, meaning they didn't issue refund but there was a hold on bank account. Second instance noticed a charge on my bank statement for item I did not purchase. Turns out it was for a return I made back in December. Called Customer Service said it was an error in the system. But I believe if I had not called it would not have been corrected. "

John Pollock,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I thought I would share this information with anyone looking to replace their Kindle Fire. I purchased a new Fire in Nov.24 to replace one I had been using for a few years and was showing signs of slowing up to ensure all my content would still be available. Especially games, my progress, purchases, etc. It appears even though you buy the in-app purchases from Amazon they do not backup your progress, data. etc. Your books, files, etc are stored in the cloud but not that information. SO, even if you've spent hundreds of pounds playing games that they have supplied all the information is lost when your kindle gives up the ghost (which It will do eventually when the battery is exhausted usually about 5/6 years). I took this up with Amazon and no apology, no refund, just a statement that this is what happens. Oh, and a suggestion I should contact the games developer for assistance. Spent days trying that. I wonder how many people know that is the case when they buy a replacement KINDLE DEVICE. Personally I love Amazon but I am furious that I now have to start at the beginning with games I have been playing for years. I feel better now."
Stacie,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"My packages that are supposed to be delivered next day or same day show up days to a week later.

I might receive emails stating the delivery is running late, but don't get one that says it will be delivered next week. This has become a common theme. I have also watched the delivery drivers throw the package out of the vehicle, snap a picture and go speeding off.They need to change their claim of same day/next day delivery to maybe you'll see it in a week delivery."

I placed an order for a Nikke Anis figure and selected the flex-pay. Wondering if the process went through as it should have, I checked my credit card balance and they charged the full amount! At this point I have to wait until the item gets to me and then send it back. But that's not all. Even when it was received it took a week for a refund. In the meantime, cs gives me every excuse why this process takes so long. if Amazon's site was designed better this wouldn't have happened. Why even have a feature or option that does't work?

Ordered other items marked for overnight delivery and while one item arrived 45 late another item still not here.  Then another purchase labeled for a delivery date has already been changed to three days later.Amazon used to have delivery service you could rely on which enabled a buyer to be home for the delivery, seems they need to re-evaluate there delivery service."

Effy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On February 11, 2025, I purchased an item from Amazon, scheduled for delivery on February 13, 2025. Unfortunately, the item was delivered while I was not home, and when I returned, a third party had taken the package. I checked with my neighbors, but none of them had received it.I immediately contacted Amazon on the same day to report the issue. Their customer service advised me to wait until Saturday, February 15, 2025, before officially reporting the package as missing. Following their instructions, I waited and then contacted them again when the package was still missing.Amazon then requested that I report the issue to the police and obtain a crime reference number, which I did. They further requested a copy of the police report. However, when I contacted the police, they informed me that Amazon would need to request the report directly as part of the due process. Despite this, Amazon has refused to do so and insists that unless I provide the report myself, they will not take any further action.  I contacted the police again in which the police said Amazon are just trying to dodge paying to get the report because that is the due process. This is really frustrating "

I have experienced poor treatment from Amazon multiple times, with customer service hanging up on me or leaving me on hold indefinitely until I gave up. And when I called today to ask why I still hadn‚Äôt received my refund, I was told I now have to wait an additional 10-15 days!When I asked if they would compensate me for their repeated mistakes and the outrageously long wait time, I was met with a cold ""no."" No respect, no accountability‚Äîjust a completely indifferent attitude as if I, as a customer, should simply accept their failures without consequences for them.Amazon should face consequences for treating their customers this way.

Constance Schmitt Newgard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Its Valentines day 2025.  What did I get for Valentines day?  An AMEX statement full of Amazon charges without any explanation for what the charges are for.  When I called the customer service number I got a customer service person whom I could barely understand.  Those are not good business practices:  The billing and the customer service were not illuminating or helpful and frankly unethical.  Customers should know what they are paying for without having to call customer service manned by people the customer can't understand.  The investment in time and money to use Amazon services is not worth it.  If you like or even love yourself a little bit, I suggest avoiding using Amazon.  Spend your precious Friday Valentine's day  afternoon time on a holiday better than trying  to resolve billing questions."

Jeff,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is a complaint alleging breach of contract and fraud against AMAZON. The facts are as follows. On January 15, 2025, I placed  ORDER #114-7737609-3365031 with AMAZON to deliver birthday gifts to a friend. The total price was $405 and expected delivery was January 21. My credit card was billed for the full amount of ‚Ç¨402.15 on January 17, and the products allegedly shipped the next day.Nothing arrived on the 21st but I received a message that delivery was delayed until January 24. I was offered to start a refund, but heard there were storms along the east coast so decided to be patient. As of JANUARY 27, AMAZON‚Äôs website showed the gifts still in transit, with no new delivery date projected, so I decided to request proof of delivery or a refund. AMAZON‚Äôs chat feature promises to go at your own pace, but does not tell users that AMAZON employees can end the chat when they want, erase the chat history, and block you from getting a transcript. Once in chat, I was subject to a revolving door of employees who refused to answer basic questions to escalate my concerns or provide any documentation about order status. I was told that in order to process a refund, AMAZON needed my ID and then had to conduct an ‚Äòinvestigation‚Äô to prevent fraud or abuse, but there is no federal law requiring need for an ID when an item is ordered but never delivered. Plus, as there was no need for an ID when my credit card was charged, all AMAZON  has to do is return the funds in the same way they were taken.Inasmuch as AMAZON  has been breached multiple times, I refused to submit an ID, nor was there any need to do so. Plus, there is nothing to investigate‚Äîif the gifts were delivered, then AMAZON needed to prove delivery; as of FEBRUARY 11, however, their website shows order my order was 'lost' in transit, so there is nothing more to investigate. Rather than answer questions about where my order is, employees ended the chats and disappeared and refuse to make good. This behavior is unacceptable and constitutes fraud."

Mr I Mathieson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"STILL waiting my refund. Returned my items on the 27th of January and after 2 weeks I contacted customer services, which is a nightmare in itself, only to be told that the refund was being processed and was on its way. When it still didn't arrive I called back today and was initially told that a full refund had been paid on the 3rd of February? Which it hadn't and I had bank statement proof to show this. I was refunded ¬£23.99 for one item but not the remaining ¬£569 for the other? I was then told that after checking that I would have to wait until the 30th of March 2025 at the latest until the item could be refunded? When I asked where I could complain to I was told to respond to the email that would be sent to me. Here's the kicker. The email I received stated that my refund would be processed when the item had been returned? Even though they had already acknowledged receipt of it? Worse still the email sent is a no reply email, so I couldn't respond if I wanted to? It seems like Amazon DON'T want them to contact them? I have no confidence that my refund will ever turn up, especially having already been told that it was on  the way and had even been refunded in full? The whole system is SO infuriating and it is a major task just trying to contact anybody who can help. I am currently ¬£569 out of pocket and having to wait 2 months to find out if the refund is even being sanctioned? If and once my refund appears I will be deleting my Amazon account and never use them again. VOTE WITH YOUR FEET. DON'T USE AMAZON"
Joseph,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I've only had positive experiences with Amazon over the last few years when it comes to shopping. I feel like I get my money's worth as a Prime subscriber for the 'free' shipping and average annual savings which exceed what I pay for prime (according to the stats I see on my account). Their customer service is good by modern standards, they were even able to credit my account the difference in price on a CPU I purchased moments before there was a price drop (much appreciated, btw). The 0% financing they offer on some products is a useful feature, though it only applies to products sold by Amazon itself and not third parties.I won't factor in their digital products to my rating, however, I think it warrants covering in my review.Adding ads to Prime was a mistake, but if you must do it, you should limit them to preroll ads and only one per episode or movie. I was watching The Tick on my Fire Tv and it was interrupted twice with two or three ads each episode"

We had Amazon call us through the help/contact part of their site. Did anyone know that they now email you a ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, a 6 digit number, that you have to tell the driver when they come to your door? Well, that would have been all well and good, and we would have figured that out if the driver actually DID come to the door, but NO ONE DID! NO KNOCK! We have a dog that definitely would have alerted us if someone was here. The agent told me that they will ‚Äúattempt‚Äù to deliver again tomorrow. I am livid, asked for a supervisor, and told him that we would be expecting the package TONIGHT, OR ELSE!!! We figure that that won‚Äôt happen, but my husband will be home tomorrow and waiting for another email (if that‚Äôs the new process, but who knows?) and another ‚Äúattempt‚Äù. They had better deliver! We are canceling our accounts after that."

About 9.45pm I get a message from Amazon saying that they made the 1st delivery attempt and it was failed, so they will try again next day. I was supprised how they make the attempt even the delivery guy didn't show up on my location. Called the customer service they also not helpful. Dissapointed and frustrated with these people. "

Item had been clearly used and wrong size sent (presumably hoping I wouldn‚Äôt notice). What a terrible shopping experience, now I have to play sport and hope my ankle holds out. Have returned item and gone with original vendor I found on Google. I‚Äôm done with Amazon and am happy to buy direct and pay delivery costs on important items.

Mandy Flood,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"This morning l received an email stating my subscribe& save items would be delivered today. But only a part order arrived and the rest was on another delivery vehicle. The additional items were 2 stops 7 miles away from my home for over 2 hours according to delivery tracking. On contacting Amazon  customer service l informed them that the 7 mile distance had now increased an additional 23 miles away. I was assured the rest of the order would arrive today & it did. When l saw the courier l politely asked with a smile how he could be 7 miles away from my home initially & then end up in New Milton which is nowhere near me. His response was l changed my maps, l have been in a different country. He was and l don‚Äôt mean this rudely from a different country. I have had monthly contact with customer service every month for the past 7/8 months with regards to delivery problems. From my delivery instructions being ignored the door not knocked and order handed to me & giving me time to get to door as l am disabled resulting in orders stolen because they were left on doorstep in full view of passersby on a residential main road. To general awful service. I use Amazon as l thought it would make my life easier but l am now rethinking why pay for Amazon prime subscription when the services are going downhill fast. I have recently used the chat option when having to contact Amazon as  very seldom do l get somebody l can understand if l use the call me option. It seems the customer service is outsourced to India and l don‚Äôt like having to repeat myself or ask the other person to slow down their speech so it‚Äôs easier to understand them. Also l don‚Äôt wish to be addressed by my Christian name  by these strangers in a phone call. Far too familiar for my liking. Please sort out these problems Amazon l can‚Äôt be the only person who is disappointed in recent service with the company.As way of apology for inconvenience today l was told by the customer service person a ¬£5.00 gift card would be added to my account but that was 3 hours ago & it is yet  to arrive in my account. Update it‚Äôs now the 16th February and l still haven‚Äôt received the ¬£5.00 gift card to my Amazon account. Really bad customer service experience!"

Amazon you are a thief but let me tell you. I‚Äôll get my money back.  EASY to switch out an item for another one thats broken.  I promise you I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK 3x‚Äôs the amount you took AND REFUSED TO RETURN.  Amazon is a thief.  eBay has many of the same items Amazon sells and their customer service is in English!!!!  I switched from Amazon home of sticky fingers for retailers who don‚Äôt steal from customers and only shopping at stores that offer customer service in ENGLISH.

Anthony F.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Amazon since 1999.  Since that time,  I have left very detailed and well written reviews.  So much so, that a few years ago I was invited to be one of Amazon's ""Vine"" reviewers.  These are reviewers who receive their choice of available free products from sellers to review.  I did this for a year until I found it to be not worth the time. My issues with Amazon however is this.First, the quality of their items, shipping, packing, and oversight of their third party system is terrible.  I am disabled and rely upon ordering online for almost everything I need.  As such, at one time it was typical of me to order from Amazon two or more times a week. When I order, I also spend amazing amounts of time with reviews before purchasing, going through Amazon's barely useful search system to compare prices, and other things.Because of my very frequent and long years of using Amazon's website, I have become aware of some rather disingenuous and downright deceptive ways in which their site functions.  For one, you cannot nor should depend upon the default ""Top Reviews"" as they appear.  They are essentially useless, especially today and with products that have been available on Amazon for a few years.  These reviews are often outdated and do no reflect the current status of either the product, its quality changes, or even Amazon's shipping issues, amongst other things. It is best to change that default to ""Recent Reviews"".  That is where you will see the most revealing and often disheartening reviews about a product. And it won't matter much whether it is a big name brand or not.  As in the past ten years, many long existing companies have reduced many aspects of their manufacturing to garner higher and higher profits at your expense.  As a result their products may look good (as modern manufacturing and design can definitely make them, especially with current plastic extrusion molding methods), the fact is they are made far cheaper, reduced quality control, and with planned obsolescence in mind.  It is no joke, no fantasy, but a real situation.  It is here you will also discover a trend that has arisen with Amazon in the past five years as well.  The number of used, returns, and possibly seconds being sold as brand new by Amazon is astounding.  That and their shoddy packing due to the low moral, sad working conditions, etc., of their packers affects the way items eventually reach you.  Word of warning.  If you change the default of ""Recent Reviews"" too often, that function will vanish from the review section.  It is the only element on Amazon's product pages that does this (aside from frequent price changing).  But take heart, you only need reload the page a few times and it will return.  It is a headache, but that is the point.  To dissuade you from being able to see the actuality of what the situation is with what you are purchasing.As for the countless items from China available on Amazon, be forewarned.  These exact same items are being sold directly out of China on Temu, AliExpress, and elsewhere.  However, Amazon is charging on average two to four times more for them.  In fact I included this information in a review of a product I purchased from Amazon, only to have my review privileges revoked.  That was two years ago. And since, I can no longer leave reviews, nor even contact sellers to inquire about specific questions about a product. According to Amazon, I have gone against their ""Community Standards"".  Community Standards?  Read those words and let them sink in for a moment to understand their irony. As a result, I no longer use Amazon unless I have absolutely no alternative.  The first reason being that over the past two years, two out of three orders are problematic.  Either the item is wrong, broken, expired, damaged, extremely late, etc.  Second, since I've discovered that so much of what Amazon sells is actually from China, and they are now selling directly to us for far lower prices, why continue ordering from Amazon?  Especially in those cases, when the quality may not be up to specs, are fakes or knock-offs (and yes, they are on Amazon), only to pay so much more for them?  For the three day delivery of Prime, which unless it is delivered by Amazon, is anything but three day.  No.  That is silly.  And the argument that you are supporting your nation's brand is even more ludicrous.  First, Amazon has a horrible labor reputation.  Second, Amazon is the Walmart of the internet retail business and as such has systematically worked to dominate as many retail industries it can move into and all for the sole purpose of driving everyone else out of business, which it has done since the the late 1990s. Jeff Bezo's its CEO/Founder is now one of the wealthiest men in world. In fact, him, Musk, and Zuckerberg have more wealth than the entire bottom half of the U.S., population."

Meron Desta,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has completely transformed the way we shop, but not without significant consequences. Countless stores have closed their doors due to Amazon's dominance, leading to many people losing their businesses and jobs. With such overwhelming market power, few can compete with Amazon today. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in some of the worst customer support experiences. It seems that either Amazon fails to properly train its agents or simply doesn‚Äôt prioritize customer service, knowing they face little accountability. Many of these agents come across as rude and disrespectful, leaving customers feeling undervalued and frustrated.I wish consumers would start boycotting Amazon before it‚Äôs too late‚Äîthough it might already be. I often feel like we're a herd being chased by a single lion. The difference is that we‚Äôre humans with the power to think and make choices. We can pause and consider how to prevent Amazon from becoming our only option, not just for shopping but in every aspect of our lives."

On second delivery date, fridge freezer never turned up, contacted customer services to be informed that they don't know where my second order was and they'd have to investigate which will take another 72hrs and then email me with another delivery date.

PKluger,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Beware of Amazon.When you purchase a CD they may tell you that your purchase will come with a free MP3 download. A lot of the time it is a big lie. When you complain about it, they will make up some story.Also, if you elect to purchase an MP3 you need to check the number of tracks. For instance, I wanted to buy an MP3. The CD had 25 tracks of music, but the MP3 only was going to give me 10 tracks. You need to check on this before buying. Trust me on this. They do this all the time. Also, beware of Amazon selling defective DVD's which freeze, skip, or simply will not play episodes at all. This recently happened to me when I purchased One tree Hill. Amazon would not do anything. I think sometimes when you send it back, they resell it to another sucker. (just my opinion)"

M C Green,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer for YEARS, but recently they seem to be becoming sloppy in various ways. The one that has been increasingly annoying me is the reviews‚Ä¶ When I am buying something I don‚Äôt normally buy, and don‚Äôt know much about, I find the reviews useful, but increasingly, it has come to my notice that MANY of the reviews have ZERO relation to the item in question. For example, I was looking for an rechargeable razor to give as a present - for someone who is bald. The choice was overwhelming - so, I looked to see which razors had the most 5 X star reviews. I found one that had hundreds of 5x Star reviews, and thought ‚ÄúWOW, this must be a really good razor!‚Äù I was almost going to click ‚Äòbuy now‚Äô, when my gut feeling told me to check a few of the reviews‚Ä¶ In the end I read over 20 of the reviews. Every one related to a stand for an Alexa Echo!! I then checked another razor with - seemingly - hundreds of 5-star reviews‚Ä¶. EXACTLY the sane thing- the reviews bore ZERO relation to the item!! As this is NOT the first time this has happened, I thought I should inform Amazon. The person I spoke to was completely uninterested. She said ‚ÄúAmazon do not get involved in the reviews- they have nothing to do with us‚Äù. I pointed out that people rely on the reviews, so they SHOULD get involved, if the reviews OFTEN bear zero relation to the product that is being advertised on their site. I thought it was perhaps just a careless employee, so I tried calling again. Same thing. Totally uninterested. Amazon need to up their game.

They recently lost my parcel a couple of days before the delivery date. They did not notify me of this, I only saw a note on my order page. So I contacted support (very difficult to get hold of them BTW), and the person promised me verbally and in writing by email ""You can place a new order for this item and once item gets delivered we will refund shipping charge for you"". I reordered the item, and 5 days later they said by email ""I've successfully processed a refund to your Original payment card. You'll see the refund on your card statement in the next 5-7 business days"". Only the refund never appeared in my account. So I contacted them yet again. This time I was told that the refund will not be processed, because they do not have that option. By this time I already purchased the same items twice, and paid two sets of shipping. To say I am annoyed with Amazon is an understatement. For the record I've been a loyal customer for decades, and a Prime customer. And what is Bezos doing with all the money he takes from us?

We have since challenged this, explaining the full details with still no justice.

Reviews should be an open and honest reflection of what a buyer goes through, not just a narrowly controlled evaluation.It sounds like Amazon is systematically filtering out reviews that don‚Äôt fit their preferred structure, which really undermines genuine customer feedback. Their approach seems designed to prevent negative aspects of the overall experience‚Äîlike poor packaging, bad seller behavior, or misleading pricing‚Äîfrom being easily visible.Who has the time to write 1,2,3 separate reviews?!

Donna Rogers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought a pair of gold earrings on 2/1/25. They came defective. I asked to send back for a refund. They said seller would send me a prepaid label. Never happened. Then I emailed them back on 2/9/25 and they said I would get a refund on their A-Z Guarantee. They asked me to send a photo I did of the defect. Then they denied me. Emailed back and said I need these sent back and refund me. They said you will get a refund today, I said show me proof because nothing you have said happened. Then he sends me another A-Z Guarantee claim. I said they already denied me for nothing. I have filed complaints on Amazon with the FTC and BBB. They are trying to rip me off on their defective garbage."

However, upon checking my porch, I couldn't find the package. After contacting the local sheriff, it was confirmed that the package was in fact delivered to the wrong address and it was not stolen.I have made numerous attempts to resolve this issue and have complied with all your requests. However, the sheriff informed me that it is not possible to file a report for a missing package if no crime has been committed. He suggested that I make a report stating that Amazon had stolen the package, but I was not comfortable with this option and wanted to give it a thought.This email is my last attempt to seek a resolution for this matter. It is unacceptable that I have been waiting for my order and now I have to deal with such an unpleasant situation. I demand a full refund for the two items that I have ordered, the AlphaTheta DDJ-FLX2 DJ Controller and the LORELEI X8 Over-Ear Headphones. I understand that it was not your intention to cause this inconvenience, but the fact that the package was delivered to the wrong address is solely Amazon's responsibility.I have been informed by the sheriff that such incidents happen quite frequently and it is considered a waste of time and resources to file a false report. Hence, it is impossible for me to provide any further documentation without your cooperation I could also make it a step further and open a civil case against amazon and the driver who deljver the in question package and anyone else involved. Therefore, I request you to process the refund at the earliest without any further delay.In case you need any information or details from my end, I am more than willing to provide it. I will also cooperate with the police if they require any assistance in their investigation. However, I urge you to take immediate action and resolve this issue. I am confident that with your prompt customer service, we can find a solution to this problem.I hope to hear back from you soon regarding the status of my refund. Your prompt action and response will be highly appreciated.Sincerely,James Vogelsanger"

It was damn near impossible to speak or chat to someone at Amazon to get them to release the hold (even though, they already had my money!). I talked with my bank and found out that Amazon placed a a merchant hold for the transaction that expired in a week. The bank could do nothing about it, even though my account showed an effective double payment! This is WRONG and not consumer friendly at all!

David Gay,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,In January 2025 i returned some Virtual Reality Headset items as they were not suitable and subsequently received an email from Amazon's OFM team (the online fraud management team) telling me i had breached return guidelines as the items returned were damaged - had missing parts - were obviously used or returned outside of the return window.  I strongly refuted this assesssment and applealed against that decision - asking the OFM team for further details. I sent about 15 emails to them - all were ignored. A week later i made a formal  complaint about the lack of response regarding my appeal and the accusations they had made. After 7 working days - when i was told the OFM team would respond - i rang again to complain to someone more senior - only to be told that there was nothing more i could do apart from send OFM a message. As they had already ignored 15 messages and a formal complaint i decided that there was no point in doing that. They also told me that customers are not advised of the findings of their complaints - EVER - as the findings are kept internal. The seem to think this makes them the world's most customer centric organisation - they are completely and totally dellusional - their ratings on Trust Pilot clearly show  they are one of the most pathetic organisations on the planet.

They told me that one item was delivered (argued about this). I told them I received nothing. They said they had a photo of the item - it wasn't my apartment. I told them I wanted a refund and to cancel the rest of my order. They refused. I've had issues with Amazon before but this time I will make a formal complaint against them. This is nothing less than pure fraud. And sadly they get away with it. I'm not going to pay for something I never received and I don't want the rest of the order.

Shaun,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,So after purchasing a product from what is supposed to be a third party seller the product still not delivered even though I changed the delivery address to a pick up point as I was home every time they said the courier arrived. Obviously not my dogs would of said had anyone been near the house. Amazon has said the third party seller is responsible yet when I left a review for this third party seller saying the service was rubbish Amazon put a footnote sayjng it wasn‚Äôt the sellers fault then five minutes later deleted the review altogether. All this without telling me. Obviously the mysterious third party seller is probably Amazon itself using another name as even after searching online there is nothing about this company anywhere else except to say it‚Äôs a trusted seller of Amazon. ü§î.

Tara Hall,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Unbelievable!! Thieves are running amuck at Amazon- just finished 'chatting' with 'Brent'- a supervisor- who did not read the 7 correspondences I have had the past 30 days. He said I was not due a refund bc I did not return the replacement- THEY cancelled the replacement of $100+ golf balls. Three times they said the refund should show up on credit card- it never has. First- shipment of Titleist balls were shipped to a locker- we have no locker- just a mailbox. Second- they promised refund would be in 3-5 days. Third- no refund- but an empty box with no balls showed up 9 days later. Fourth- requested refund again. Again 3-5 business days.Fifth- said I must mail product back- there was no product- just a box. So I mailed the box back through UPS who said this happens 'a lot'Sixth- now they tell me it's beyond the 30 days to mail back even though I mailed the box back at day 14.Liars! Liars!! Rashmeet was also one of the 7 I chatted with- they should all be fired. 
whypeoplewhyy VT,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"This review is gonna hurt to write. It's a shame, because I have nothing but good memories with Amazon. Lightning fast deliveries, superb customer service and barely any delays. That was until I learned about everything that was happening behind the scenes with the workers, layoffs and much more. Just today, I received the worst/most apathetic customer service, I have ever experienced in my life. Not to mention that there are confirmations of increased taxes on imported goods? Amazon. It's been fun, but I am only going to use your services on an ""as needed"" basis. America? This is the time to save and spend less. (as we should all be doing) If you don't need it? Just don't buy it. (especially certain external hard drives. Be very careful when purchasing from the tech companies of Bufflao and WD, due to faulty external hard drives)  Amazon is still fantastic, but as of today? I just don't know how to feel about one of my favorite companies anymore. The fact that they have lost their way like many other corporations from the past, honestly makes me feel guilty that I ever supported them to begin with. Do better Amazon and treat your workers like a precious treasure. I adore every single one of them, including the delivery drivers. If I could tip them? I would! Till next time Amazon. Just cancelled my prime membership too. What a shameful display. "

No updates were received regarding its status. The online customer service conveniently incurred 'technical issues' when challenged and therefore unable to handle the query. Being passed around several members of staff, each with a 'technical issue', is appalling. Amazon.com then decide that the order is being shipped and cannot be cancelled. I, the customer, would have to return it (at a cost to me - I am in the UK and ordering from the US).What kind of service is this?

TiptreeJam,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"The Amazon experience for me is not what it used to be. I now have items delivered to Asda for collection or an Amazon Locker as some drivers are unable to find my house (not moved in the 20+ years I have used Amazon). Bought three items recently which came in one package. On opening one item was missing (I thought it was too light). I contacted Amazon through chat. The first person seemed unable to comprehend - asked me to send a photo of the missing item! Transfered to another person who said they would give credit. However they credited for all three items, not just the missing item, and it said 'damaged in transit'. I may go back on chat again to pay back the extra but not sure if my nerves could stand it. I reorderd the missing item which was delivered to an Amazon Locker. However the email did not give me a code/barcode to open the locker. It just said 'bring identification when you pick it up'. As expected there was no Amazon employee standing next to the locker waiting to see my identification so I waited and the next day I got a reminder with the locker code added on. Going up to the locker today to hopefully get the item! I shopped online again yesterday but skipped Amazon and bought from two other companies - both cheaper than Amazon and one is being delivered today and the other I pickup later. "

I didn‚Äôt find out with either package HOW it was getting delivered until after they couldn‚Äôt be delivered. This needs to get updated!

teragramh,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a Seiko mechanical watch from the Amazon site on 12/22/24. The watch was for my husband who has been wearing it consistently (except for showers or other water-related activities or activities that could damage the watch) since received 12/24. My husband noticed that the watch was losing time. Via Amazon he reached out to Seiko as instructed. Seiko told him to send the watch to them for repair, which he did, at his own expense. He sent the watch on 1/25/25. He was informed 2/5/25 that the watch was working within their norm despite it losing 20 seconds of time per day to pay for return postage in order to have the watch returned. We were dissatisfied with the Seiko response. Since we did not have a good resolution from Seiko, I reached out to Amazon Customer Service for help. Due to the sequence of returning the watch to Seiko and not getting a response until 2/5/25, we missed the Amazon return date. The customer service rep, Jessa, was pleasant but was not as helpful as hoped. I explained that my husband and I are good customers of Amazon, spending hundreds of dollars on their platform each year. This was not effective in getting the resolution I hoped. My husband would have accepted an exchange for the same watch but this was not allowable. Jessa just kept referring me back to Seiko who was not helpful either. Subsequently, we have lost $306.34. I am extremely disappointed with Seiko and even more so with Amazon. Even as a good-will gesture they could have offered to exchange the watch. The amount we lost on the watch is a drop in the bucket for Amazon but a bucketful of drops for me and my husband."
Steve,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Customer service or Amazon Executive Relations as they call themselves are in my experience absolutely useless and totally uninterested in resolving complaints.There is no complaint handling policy at Amazon and the only way to get them to reply is to raise the complaint directly with the UK Managing Director who just fobs it off to the executive relations team who aren't bothered and send one reply, without answering any of the complaints then ignore you, then block you if you continue to demand a response.My complaint was false delivery - stated my parcel was delivered to me but wasn't and I even caught up to the driver on their very next stop who 'couldn't remember' where they had just delivered my parcel to less than 2 minutes ago on the same short street, then became aggressive and mouthed off when I didn't believe them.Amazon then delivered my next order a day earlier than I specifically requested and so had to cancel my plans for the day.The refund for my false parcel delivery supposedly 'errorred' and they didn't bother telling me or refunding it, leading to me being overdrawn.Executive Relations team clearly offshore and not interested in dealing with customer complaints and the fact that Amazon does not have a complaint handling policy seems to demonstrate that they don't care about customer issues in my experience."

I was forced to call the toll free number                        1-877-345-3364 ( as I am unable to chat with an agent online ) on Mon Jan 27, Wed Jan 29, Thurs Jan 30 , Sat Feb 1 , Sun Feb 2 and lastly Wed Feb 5, 2025. With each occasion, I was made to feel like I am a bother and wait 24 hours for a reset, and agents would just hang up on me. The form or reset to my account never came. This is very POOR customer service!2.	Return of Incorrect Products:I received two incorrect products and need to initiate returns. However, because I am locked out of my account, I am unable to process these returns. I am concerned that I am running out of time to return these items, as the return window may close soon.3.	Status of a Third Product:I am also trying to determine the status of a third product I ordered, but I cannot access my account to check the order details or tracking information.				I urgently request the following:1.	Immediate assistance in regaining access to my account.2.	A secure method to verify my identity and resolve the unauthorized access issue.3.	Assistance in processing the returns for the two incorrect products, as I am unable to do so myself due to the account lockout.4.	An update on the status of the third product I ordered.Previous Attempts to Resolve:I have contacted Amazon Customer Service seven times via phone and was assured each time that a form would be sent to me within 24 hours. Unfortunately, I have not received any such form, and my issue remains unresolved.Urgency:This matter is time-sensitive, as I am at risk of losing the opportunity to return the incorrect products and need clarity on the status of my third order. I trust that Amazon values its customers and will prioritize resolving this issue promptly.Thank You:SergioEmail: sergio*******@yahoo.caPhone Number: [999] 999 9999Account Email: [unavailable, as account is locked]Order Numbers: [[unavailable, as my email has been tampered with]I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.

Noiz Uchiha,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am so pissed off with Amazon it all started when I pre-ordered a PS5 game called honkai star rail on the 22 January as the game was coming out on the 31 January I kept on checking every other day to see how my order was doing and it was suck at just ordered keep in mind this was on day 4 with it still saying that I ordered, in the end I stopped the order and then about a hour after I re ordered it on the 1 feb the same  two copies of the game one to go to my husband and one to go to me. the thing is both said out today and my husbands came at 1:30 this afternoon where he is and my one has not come yet and this is just a piss take why mess with somebody who PRE ORDERED the games to not even get one the day the game comes out to then have to wait more just for my game to come so unfair to people like me who PRE ORDERED so I will now do NO shopping on amazon once they understand how people like me feel they will not get anymore money from me at all and I am now going to end my amazon prime too."

Tomasz Rzepiela,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a product worth $200 as a Christmas gift, but Amazon sent me the wrong item‚Äîsomething worth 10 times less! Instead of simply shipping the correct product, they insisted I return the wrong item first. I did so immediately, but then nothing happened for 30 days. Every time I contacted support, they just repeated that their policy allows them 30 days for a refund.After the 30 days passed, I still didn‚Äôt receive my money back. Instead, customer service kept changing the refund processing date or making up new reasons why my claim couldn‚Äôt be resolved yet. It feels like they are just stalling and trying to avoid giving me my money back. I have likely lost $200, and this has been the worst shopping experience I‚Äôve ever had. Be very careful when shopping on Amazon!"

Tiffany Zappulla,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"How the mighty have fallen. There is no longer a way to easily contact customer service - I have to actually Google a customer service number that routes me a hundred different ways on an automated menu before I get to a human. Amazon started messing up countless orders beginning last year to a great degree of inconvenience to myself. They recently completely botched two items I returned by mixing up the labels with that of an item I did not request to return. Conveniently, they refunded me for the cheaper item I kept and tried to take my money for the two more expensive items I returned. I'm sure this was intentional and there is now a class action lawsuit in process for this due to them doing it to countless other customers. After my third call to resolve the issue I was sent a follow-up email containing boilerplate text with typos, repeated four times in a row in the email. I thought it was a phishing attack but it came from the actual Amazon customer service email. I finally cancelled my account. "

They can take weeks to issue a refund as their return sytem not operating correctly , their on line associate chat service designed for them not to assist and the customer has to try to get their refunds issued but sometimes may never get the refund even though item returned. I returned a dress in December  showed 17 December on their own return system was in transit today 5 February took money out of my account saying dress not reurned on an email they sent me. Went onto customer service sent emails yes 2 asking me to fill in forms and eventually they may look into their sytem failure and give me my money back , but sadly think I am wating my time may never see my money again .

Angela Ehr,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've been an Amazon customer for over 20 years and their customer service used to be pretty good.  They were building the empire so it was important to offer products that could be delivered and make the transaction 'right', if possible.  I've noticed, since COVID, that the reviews have gotten more and more positive for products that are more and more substandard.  The last straw for me is when I ordered a rain jacket for next day delivery.  I ALWAYS check that it's in stock and can be delivered when I want it delivered; otherwise, I choose a different color or different product.  This jacket was ordered, I got the confirmation email and we were off to the races.  The next day, I got an update that it had not yet shipped.  Uh oh...  As of this review, the jacket still hasn't shipped, and no one will tell me where the hell it is in the system.  All the outsourced agents will say is it's in advanced shipping stage and will ship soon. One even told me he canceled the order and the email was on it's way to me.  BULL!  If Amazon employs people who are told to lie, if necessary, they don't need to be in business.  If they offer a product and it's in a warehouse somewhere, alert someone on the line and cancel the order.  PERIOD.   I want this jacket to get to my son in this century.  Obviously, with Amazon, it won't...and they don't give a rip.  "
Tabish,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had an awful experience with Amazon UK regarding an order for Lindor Chocolates (Order ID: 205-4455463-2807552). The delivery was marked as ""left in the garden"" on 29th November, but the image provided was not of my property, and I never received the package.I reached out to customer service multiple times and provided my UK BRP and DL three times, yet they kept rejecting my documents and asking for the same information over and over. It felt like Amazon was pulling a fast one on me, deceiving me with a false delivery image and refusing to take responsibility for my order.This experience has left me feeling completely defrauded and deeply frustrated. I expected better from a company of this size, and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with how this situation has been handled."

T. Kng,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt the necessity to review an apple watch I bought in December and also review the seller of the watch. This apple watch is one Amazon's refurbished devices which they call ""Renewed"". The seller ""Super Tech Deals Limited"", thought it was a good idea to sell a watch full of scratches and described it as excellent, which cost a lot more than a watch categorized as good or fair. The watch had scratches on the front screen and back, came in an unbranded brown dirty box. I contacted Amazon customer service to return the watch and I was sent a return slip that was not prepaid, just the address of the seller, I queried why the slip was not prepaid, and the agent told me that I will be refunded for both the watch and postage. The seller, ""Super Tech Deals Limited"" received the watch and have the audacity to ask me why I returned it, stating that the watch is in good working condition. I pointed out the obvious marks on the watch. After about a week, the seller refunded just the cost of the watch without the postage, when I asked them for postage cost, they told me in quote""Unfortunately, Amazon cannot agree to refunds on our behalf.I'm afraid we are unable to process a refund higher than the amount initially paid.If you contact Amazon regarding this, they may be able to refund you the amount paid, as an Amazon agent incorrectly informed you of the returns process.""In other words, a dishonest seller on Amazon platform, who described a heavily used watch full of scratches will not refund the cost of return ... this is huge.I decided to write a review of this seller to warn others but unfortunately after 3 different attempts, Amazon blocked my reviews. Below is Amazon's responses to my review:""We could not post your review because it focuses on one or more of these topics:SellersDeliveryPackagingPricingAvailability""There's no denying that Amazon is now a monopoly and will block honest reviews off their platform. Amazon is silencing customers from mentioning poor service from a seller which is an integral part of the whole transaction, just unbelievable!I have amended the reviews each 3 times, even reducing it to about 50 words and still all reviews blocked. Amazon prime cancelled and I will seek alternative platform."

Donata DuPree,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I pay for a Prime subscription to be able to get deliveries on time, I live only a few miles away from an Amazon fulfillment center, I spend extra money to have next-day delivery, I stay home to get the delivery and then I get a notification from Amazon that the items have been 'delayed'.  No reason, no idea when the items may be delivered, no idea where the items are, and no tracking.  Customer service is useless, they'll claim the order is on the truck when it's not.  Then, two to three days later, I get the option to cancel the order and reorder if I want to.  When I choose that option I find I have been blocked from receiving ANY deliveries sooner than four or five days out.  Deliveries made with an Amazon truck/employee usually make it on time but when they use these folks driving their personal vehicle nothing gets here on time, if at all.  I tracked a driver through Amazon's app, it showed her 3 stops away, I could have walked over to her, and then she dropped off the radar.  That was it, gone with my stuff with no explanation.  And, I'm the problem when I call customer service to complain?  Amazon's gotten too big and they need some competition."

Konstantin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"That was one of the worst experiences I had buying online. It‚Äôs terrifying that this happened with Amazon, a platform that was once famous for its customer service but is now full of people who drop the chat without answering questions.I ordered two items on December 19, 2024, and now it is February 2025, and nothing has even been shipped. The promised delivery date was January 25, 2025, but now it's delayed until March.I contacted Amazon support three times. Twice, I was promised that my concerns would be taken care of quickly. During the third contact, I received the same answer and decided to press further, because time is passing, and my items still haven't shipped. I wanted to understand what Amazon could do, considering it was famous for its customer care, right?The third reply went into a robotic form:Me: How will you help me get my items?Amazon: It will be in March.Me: What if it‚Äôs not?Amazon: We can cancel, do you want to?Me: No, I want my item.Amazon: It will be in March.Me: What if it‚Äôs not?Amazon: We can cancel, do you want to?This happened both with regular support and with a supervisor. No help was provided; they gave me the same deadlines that I can see myself in the orders section.Amazon could propose to replace the problematic item with another seller or simply state that it‚Äôs bad luck and that the order needs to be canceled. Instead, they want me to wait one more month. Then we will return to this discussion with Amazon support, and I will have the new option‚Äîto wait until May or cancel?"

When I received them the insole package was destroyed(looked previously opened), not the Amazon shipping packaging. Which leaves me to believe they sold me returned insoles someone could have worn. That is disgusting. Well I wrote a review about it and Amazon won't accept the review because it deals with the seller and packaging. They are asking me to edit it. That's censorship. They were the seller and they dealt with the packaging. They just don't want me to leave an honest review about a high selling insole that would definitely hurt that products sales."

Veronica Galvan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been shopping through Amazon and am a Prime member.  BUT, I have never purchased a high priced item before. This Christmas I bought a high-priced item. The item came unassembled. After assembly one puece of the item wouldn't fit and was not mentioned in the manual. I contacted Amazon and jumped through the canned cycle of topics. After several days I recvd a video that also bypassed the particular part. Back to Amazon non-customer service, jumping the standard topics and received a return label which requires me to pay the $200 shipping. The international customer service said for me to pay and they will reimburse me. Bringing my out of pocket expense to near $1,000. So before returning the equipment I decided to pay a professional to see if they were able to finish assembley. Turns out there are 2 defective parts. An attempt to obtain those parts is impossible because there is no way to communicate that. Even the A-Z guarantee sends an email with a link to reply addtl info sends you full circle through the process. You also cannot reply to the email. Every attempt at communication takes you back to the automated process. Absolutely No Customer Service. I'm stuck with a partially assembled piece of equipment Or, I unassembled and take the chance of getting a total refund of almost $1,000. Eating the amount paid to the professional assembler."

They give you a guaranteed delivery date then deliver early. I'm the customer. If I select a delivery date that's the delivery date I want. I don't want it two days early so psrt of the order arrives before someone's birthday. I don't want it four days early when I'm not home to receive it. The only reason to order from Amazon is because it's convenient. Due to their complete disregard for customer service, it's no longer convenient. I'm gone. I'm sure they won't miss me because they've got millions of customers willing to put up with their appalling service, More people should stand up and demand better customer service. Although when I did today all I got from an actual live person, after I refuse to converse with a bot, was a stock message about how they deliver stuff whenever it's ready.

If OSM Worldwide is used, it will take two weeks to get the book. Amazon needs to make it mandatory that their agents inform their customers what delivery service they use. I do not want to purchase from any seller who uses OSM Worldwide."
Phi,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I clicked NO for 1 Click Buys on all browsers for more security. But then I purchased an e-book on Amazon with 1 Click! Disabling 1 Click Buys does nothing! No password protection for buys. No Google Authentication code for buys. UNSAFE!Amazon literally does not care about your payment security. Anyone can jump onto your Amazon account and buy things without ANY protection. The disgraceful thing is that this problem has been there for many, many years, and Amazon just ignored it!No other company has a total disregard for payment security. At least require a PIN code for purchases!I feel sick whenever I buy from Amazon, and only buy from there if there really is no other choice. USE EBAY. Amazon has failed."

Xtina Hewlett,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolute waste of time and money. Prime service doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and the favourite get out is ‚Äòattempted delivery‚Äô while you‚Äôre home waiting and .. no parcel.

Suz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve ordered a Dyson from a smaller retailer and  Amazon delivery of the item has been appalling, lots of online robot chats then what I believe to be human chats. No follow through on delivery as requested despite my constant checking. Various new 6digit password codes but still no tracking, one nonsense conversation with a guy making promises he‚Äôd no interest in keeping or following through with, several human conversations from two helpful female customer service reps, initially to redirect the package but still no delivery despite several codes, then finally an agreement via phone today to deliver to the original address but no of course it goes the the redirected address (there was two days of waiting in for the item at that address with no delivery attempt despite several new codes suggesting it was on its way!)So obviously tired and embarrassed of disrupting my family I wait for the item- but it doesn‚Äôt come to me but goes to my son who can‚Äôt accept it as I did not give him the code as it was supposed to come to me‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve cancelled the order, apologies to the retailer I would have been happy to collect it from a depot but that wasn‚Äôt an option. Amazon had the audacity to offer a ¬£5( best they could do!, followed by a ¬£10, best they could do compensation) I have wasted an entire morning plus several lunchtimes on chats trying to direct this order- I know I should know better but really as a customer I am of no worth, ¬£10 is a direct insult to my value and time, I‚Äôve wasted at least 7 hours messaging, waiting, talking about this order and the only people affected are the retailers and customers - order cancelled and I‚Äôll think twice about my next Amazon purchase letter box items only, as they don‚Äôt actually value the customer."
Nicola,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed with my experience with Amazon‚Äôs US subscription and refund process. I unknowingly subscribed to Amazon Prime US in October 2020, believing I was signing up for the UK service. This was due to a combination of misleading promotional emails, website redirection, and a lack of clear regional distinction during the sign-up process.After noticing the charges, I reached out to Amazon for help. While they refunded the last year of membership fees, they refused to process any additional refunds for earlier charges. As a result, Amazon owes me over $600 for the incorrect subscription, which has gone unresolved.I am based in the UK, and despite my repeated requests and clarification that I never intended to use Amazon Prime US, the response I received from Amazon was unhelpful, and there was no clear route for me to escalate the matter. The staff were dismissive, leaving me frustrated and with no way to address this issue properly.I hope this review helps others avoid a similar mistake. I would also appreciate Amazon reconsidering their approach and resolving this issue fairly."

M,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have had my ability to leave reviews blocked by Amazon for over 5 years now. I was never given a reason why, nor was I given a warning. I have never knowingly abused the reviews system, nor will I in future. Amazon says they provide a team that will look into each case and hear appeals. (‚ÄúWe are here to help.If you believe this action was taken in error, or if you have additional information you would like us to consider, respond to this email or contact us at review-appeals[at]amazon.com.‚Äù)I have contacted this ‚Äúofficial‚Äù review appeals source multiple times now, writing out my case and pleading to be heard, but again & again I get an automated response that my appeal is denied, without giving me any reason why and without actually having someone legitimately look over my case. Amazon is making false claims about having a Review Appeals team. THEY DO NOT HAVE ONE. I have called customer service 5 or 6 times about this, as well. The first time the agent seemed very helpful and looked into my case for me and said the reason was because I was flagged for leaving too many reviews and being suspected as being a bot. I explained to her that I do rebates through Rebaid/Rebatekey; I bought a lot of things at once and was leaving reviews for those items. I did not receive any compensation for reviews. I just had the time and felt like leaving reviews, mostly positive, since my experiences with the items were mostly positive. She told me she would handle it and would escalate my case to the am‚Äùreviews team‚Äù and I should be able to leave reviews within 5-7 business days. Well, I waited and no change. I call again and again, with the agents telling me they will escalate the case to the ‚Äúreviews team‚Äù and the team will respond to my appeal by email at review-appeals at amazon.com. I get an email that is word for word the same, except sometimes my name is there and sometimes it‚Äôs blank, telling me my appeal is denied. I try replying to the email and get the exact same response as initially back, repeat & repeat. I‚Äôve tried dozens of times now. And each time I call, which has been about 6 or 7 times, all the agents can do is escalate my ‚Äúcase‚Äù to the ‚Äúreviews team‚Äù ‚Äî meaning an automated bot will email with a Denied stamp. There is nothing anyone can do. Amazon does not give customers or agents any means of getting in touch with an Appeal team. They LIE that they have such a team. It is an automated system and I am beyond frustrated with Amazon. They need to provide an actual real Review Appeals team that goes over these cases and that accepts appeals instead of automatically denying them!! As well, they need to tell people WHY they are getting banned, providing proof, and give customers WARNINGS before they just ban them. My husband and I pay good money for Prime and we have been excellent customers, and this is how the company treats us?"
MD,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would treat customer review scores on Amazon with extreme caution. Amazon discourages negative reviews and bans people with no explanation apparently if they leave too many negative reviews. Anyway that is my experience. Check reviews elsewhere before you buy.

Spacely Sprockets,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has followed suit with the other 98% of American companies and are beyond horrible at this point. Delivering partial packages. Prime members still waiting days or a week for packages. Not delivering packages at all. Ordering on a Monday and check the status and it says your package maybe lost ( in less than 24hrs from ordering) Not refunding your funds until you actually contact them in most cases.

Donald Gove,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has found a new way to delay the delivery of your orders, now they are putting up a notice that they have temporarily lost the signal on their drivers, that's just a delay tactic that means your delivery is late, for a company like Amazon they should not be losing the signal for their drivers, that's just b.s, other companies don't lose the signal for their drivers so why is it just Amazon, they just use it as a excuse to deliver the package a little later, I get notifications to see where my package is, then when I go to Amazon they suddenly don't know where the driver is, that's b.s it's just a ploy."

Besides the most mentioned negative reasons stated here that are true I live in Quebec Canada and Amazon has stopped dealing with Quebec workers and let go 1700 workers.

Tiziano Cinque,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have arranged a collection for a large appliance that was delivered with a missing part. I spoke to a customer rapresentative who could barely speak English, and with some effort manage to agree to a suitable collection date. I have confirmed the date 3 times as I wanted to be 100% sure to be home as I work shifts. The representative told me that yes, the collection would have been on the date I requested. I received a mail following the conversation confirming the collection for the day before the one agreed. I rang back Amazon Customer Service, I was put in touch with the relevant department handling the collection of heavy items, and spoke to a second representative whose english was terrible who kept apologising for the ""miscommunication"" and could not give me any suitable date (and frome his tone of voice it was clear that he did not care neither really tried to help). I have asked him whether I could make a formal complaint and he said thet it was not possible (!). This totally is unacceptable and also untrue. Before this last very unpleasant experience I had other issues with Amazon Cutomer Service in the past 6 to 8 months. What once was the best online company is turning into a nightmare for loyal customers. I have been a prime member for well over 10 years and I will not renew my membership. Pretty silly considering I was buying also on behalf of my business, and they will lose around 5-8k a year. Probably nothing for them but the more clients they upset the more will shift to other online marketplaces which are now more reliable, as Amazon reputation is surely gonna plummet down at this rate.BTW shame it is not possible to give a negative score like -10 stars or something like that..."

I usually spot check returns issued but I had one I didn't notice that 13 months old for a Breville Mini Smart Toaster Oven, Brushed Stainless Steel, BOV450XL. $135.93 Order # 111-0088201-2531437 . This item was returned with a smaller $ 8.00 item. The smaller item was refunded but the expensive item was not.I called amazon and was told it was to old to issue a credit. Out the product and out the money. DON'T MAKE SAME MISTAKE I MADE. CHECK AND VERIFY ALL RETURNS ARE CREDITED. Interesting enough I received a survey from Amazon about a year ago  asking if I verified my return credits and responded that I do spot check. No more trusting Amazon to be 100 % correct or honest."
Tea M Curdie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Pathetic ass company! They have stolen 50$ from me at this point. I‚Äôve been trying to get a refund for a month!!! Literally!! I did the refund in December it‚Äôs now January and coming into the first week of feb and I still cannot get my money back i have contacted them 17 times and they give me the run around every time and tell me I have to way 3 days and call back. And then when I do I have to do it all over again! I sent them the item and everything and they already received it. But They still will not give my money back! 
James,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I really wish there was another company that would compete with Amazon that customer service is terrible if you can understand what the people are saying to you, they really can‚Äôt help and please watch your bank account. They will hit you when you order and then prolong your delivery and then all of a sudden you‚Äôll receive something stating they‚Äôre charging you again if you use the fresh app to buy dog food or any kind of items such as cleaning they charge you and then if you check fresh will charge you a tip that they do not let you know I had to call and get refunded I canceled my Amazon prime membership and if I use them, I will just pay as I go, but as I‚Äôve been looking, I‚Äôm only saving maybe three dollars on items such as large dog, food bags, and cans and air freshener and things as such."
Lorraine Somerville,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Have used Amazon for years and have Prime.ALWAYS on time with my delivery. If there was something wrong with my order and the seller and I could not resolve it Amazon always stepped in lived up to their guarantee.
Gavin Robertson,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Amazon are pushing their buying options to the point that one cannot buy without the options for delivery that were common before.   If you refuse Prime or the other free delivery options they will block.   So the answer is to try to go direct to the supplier to avoid the greed from Amazon.   Hey they do not pay national taxes so why so greedy!
customer,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I purchase items based on their delivery. Amazon use to be great. I could always rely on them being true to their ""word"" for next day or two day delivery. Over the last year, they are getting worse and worse. Many times I order for my classroom, and the item do not come on time anymore for my lessons. There are times when I don't get an order at all. When I replace the order, it comes before the ""late"" order. I'm going to use them less and less. This is getting more and more frustrating!!!!"
Gary O,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered an item for Sunday delivery, nope no item delivered on Sunday just a message to say it will now be delivered on Tuesday.

Rob Germain,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought an item from Amazon with a 24 hr delivery, money was on hold with my bank meaning I can't touch this money no big deal. I waited 2 days still not shipped I called, I get I'm sorry we will escalate it, day latter still not shipped. I try 3 times to just cancel it, it wouldn't cancel, I called again they couldn't cancel (computer error?) so after long time on phone it was cancelled day latter my money was returned. Then 4 days later there trying to charge me for the same thing, called my bank, cancelled my card requesting a new one telling them what happened all set. I called Amazon AGAIN tell them stop charging me order was cancelled done! Next day they try again!! It's like seriously????I have screenshots shots off all of this, did they offer me any kind of compensation for there screw up? Nope!!Did they offer me a compensation for making my bank account tied up for over a week?? Heck no they didn't!!"
andy jones,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Have been lied too continually by people who can't even understand/speak basic English. The customer service here is a joke. I live on a side street in the middle of a busy town in-between two parks. The amount of items iv had stolen due to delivery drivers dumping the orders on our door set in full view of the public is beyond count now. Amazon even paid for a ring door bell for me as they could get thier idiot drivers ro just follow basic instruction and the police were sick of getting my calls. Having had an item I ordered actually make it one day after been dumped on the door I was annoyed to find I had been send an empty box. A box within a box with nothing inside. I called amazon and told them and they accaped the return reason. I returned the item on the 20th of dec and on the 7th they sent me a group of emails including a questionnaire and also asking why I had so many refund requested lately. I replied to the email telling them it was due to their drivers still half assing thier jobs and also not receiving the items I had paid for. No responce11th of January I get an email asking to send back the item. Called them up and they agreed that I had sent it off already and they had it but it was awaiting processing but not to worrie as I wouldn't be charged.Gets to today Jan 26th and they've charged me for the item that was an empty box. The customer service lady I spoke to was lying or didn't understand what I was saying. Had to speak with 3 people today who have told me the complete opposite of what I was told on the 11th and have now been on hold for 30 mins. Lady came back on the line apologised and then asked if I wanted to continue to wait to which I said yes and then was hung up on.
Dallas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I had so many parcel missing because of these lazy amazon delivery persons  they leave it outside my front door in an exposed space common sense ring the bell and wait or try again later then they mark it of on their phone handed to residents which is a complete lie or they leave the parcel outside the door and run of their customers service chat is also very annoying and poorly you have to repeat yourself before they can deal with the situation 
Craig Bell,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I couldn't fault them. I've ordered loads of times and I found everything spot on
Jane,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I am disgusted with Amazon who are allowing a seller in China  to fraudulently sell jumpers and cardigans on their site that are NOT made of ‚Äòcashmere‚Äô as described. Amazon will not take the advert down and make company issue immediate refund.

Mikko Mattila,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It's 5 stars when it works. 1/5 if you ever have to deal with their customer service. Their processes are appalling. Here's my story.I order a screen protector for Apple watch. It gets shipped, then rerouted back to Amazon and the order gets cancelled. Probably got damaged or something. I never get notified of a problem but I do get a refund automatically. Not notifying me is pretty bad already, but at least I got refunded automatically.I order the same thing again as a express shipment. It gets sent. Then after a couple of days the tracking information stops updating. This was about 5 weeks ago.I check order status, it says ""package may be lost"". There's a hilarious click-loop from the order page to support page to order page as you try to find a way for a refund. The UX is so bad it's not an accident (enshittification is real).I contact Amazon via chat and ask for a refund. Again, it's hilariously difficult to find the button that takes you to a real person. They ask me to wait for 3 weeks as they investigate. Sure, makes sense. Maybe the parcel will show up somewhere. Up to this point the process is still mostly acceptable. Not great but acceptable.After 3 weeks I ask for a refund again. They tell me to fill in an ""Incident report"" that basically requires me to copy-paste information from Amazon's order summary to an email. Seriously? I'm pretty angry at Amazon at this point already.After receiving the incident report they ask me to wait for 3 days as they ""investigate"". Sure, someone will go looking for the parcel, eh?I send them an email that I want a refund or I'll go to my card provider next.They tell me via a lengthy email to contact their live customer support.I reach out to live chat. They tell me to fill in the incident report again. After pointing out I already filled one, they agree to issue a refund.I must have spent at least 2 hours of my personal time in order to get the refund. Not to mention the mental energy and frustration this caused.I'll avoid Amazon if at all possible from here on."
Alfie Taylor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Disgusting customer service and support and no response is respectful or helpful. Customer services is rude and disrespectful and very unprofessional I will be taking any future issues with Amazon to a higher authority.

Renee Houston,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Many terrible poorly made products, and reduced options bc they eliminated much of the competition for their own products after putting brick & mortars out of business to try to force us to pay more for their garbage made by Chinese slaves. Donated heavily to Trump. Charge nonmembers less for same products than paying members. Delivery times keep getting longer now that they have eliminated competition. Horrible customer service. Cherry picking reviews to bolster sales of their products. The epitome of all the most evil aspects of capitalism, and put our economy and democracy in danger by supporting a fascist regime for profit. "
edmo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered 3 items to be delivered today the latest. This afternoon a private car drop-off the order and spoke to the driver asking him if the entire order was there. He did not appear to speak English and responded yes. There was only one item and now I get an automated message that the order is expected mid next week and to request a  refund if not! Seriously? Just like that. This is why I don't order from Amazon anymore. May this be the last one!

Keith,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Yet another calamitous experience with this company's packaging.Damaged as well as the contents.A once reasonable company has become one to avoid if at all possible.
kinder Helsing,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This review addresses the critical issue of a seemingly irreparably fractured company culture. The assertion that the culture is ""broken beyond repair"" suggests a pervasive and deeply entrenched set of dysfunctional behaviors and attitudes. Furthermore, the claim that management prioritizes self-promotion within the company over embracing change raises concerns about a leadership team potentially resistant to progress and innovation.Low morale and employee engagement: A broken culture often results in a disengaged and unmotivated workforce. Employees may feel unsupported, undervalued, and lacking a sense of purpose.Ineffective communication: Miscommunication and a lack of transparency can breed mistrust and hinder collaboration. Information silos and unclear decision-making processes further exacerbate the problem.Resistance to change: A culture that prioritizes stability and conformity may stifle innovation and hinder the organization's ability to adapt to evolving market demands."
Joseph Adashunas,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"They do a very poor job shipping items in my experience and therefore I usually avoid buying from them. Example would be if you want something sent to one of their shipping locker locations. I use the app to open the locker and nothing is in there. Yes, they will give you a onetime curtesy credit after a long process, but the aggravation involved. Another example is they will ship books and other items and NEVER pack them properly. Books are not wrapped or padded. Corners get all bent and covers get all scuffed form sliding in the box. Other merchandise gets banged up as little to no packing material is used."
Dean Blade,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchesed a Olive Branch dog chew on amazon and when it arrived it was full of woodworm, i tried to return it but the seller is not excepting returns so thats money down the drain , tried talking to amazon customer  care but cant keep going round in circles so gave up, do not buy theses dog chews off amazon as they are disgusting and riddled with woodworm. not fit for dogs.Just to add was contacted by amazon today sunday morning 26/01/2025 and past on to another team who wanted a picture of the woodworm ridden dog chew stick , when i told them i had put the stick in the fire they asked for my id so i used my driving licence that has my photo and address on but i no longer use as im disabled  , so they asked for another form of id now why cant they just check with amazon all i want is the ¬£9 paid for it as i was not going to keep it in the house with woodworm so to call these people thiefs is an understatement."

Manisha Singh,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is a convenient and reliable platform for shopping. It offers a massive product range with competitive prices, fast delivery (especially with Prime), and hassle-free returns. Customer reviews are helpful for making informed decisions. However, some third-party sellers can be inconsistent, so checking ratings is crucial. Overall, a fantastic shopping experience!"
M M,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Signed up for Prime because of the good deals initially offered on subscription products, particularly dog food which is quite heavy for me to carry.OK for a couple of months, then items increased in price (some doubled!), deliveries were delayed after waiting in all day for them, and items became unavailable.I've just cancelled my Prime membership as it was getting ridiculous trying to look for alternative products at decent prices. I'm wanting a relaxed shopping experience, not a mathematics exam!!"
Patricia Howard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"How can Amazon conduct a refund onto a credit card that is not in your account wallet?Amazon will only refund you at their convenience! Meaning whatever is most convenient for them when it comes to giving you a credit, or refunding it back onto your credit card. This is the first time that I have had to argue about getting a credit, usually it is the opposite. When I asked about the refund being credited instead, I was told there is nothing they can do by 4 different customer service agents."
Scott Sullivan,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I have, for some time being trying to access my account on Amazon, I believe I put a review not too long ago.

Aligning himself with the orange clown and forgetting about the hard working average American who makes his billions for him. I closed everything and anything to do with Amazon.

Oliver Powell,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Can't deliver to my house anymore even though they used to be able to.

customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This review is on Amazon as a platform provider. I bought some Leifheit Profi mop head replacements for over $50 from Amazon as a gift but it was delivered late and I had it returned. Unknown to me, the refund was made to the gift card instead of my credit card (original payment method OPM). I called Amazon on 7th Jan and spoke to Chloe, the manager of the customer service and she told me in order to refund via credit card, she would have to withdraw from the gift card. She proceeded to do so and the next day, I received an email from Amazon informing me that the refund could not be made through credit card. I called again on 9th Jan and went through an hour with another customer service who told me she would escalate to the gift card and account department for resolution. I followed up on 16th Jan by email and there has been no response since.¬†I noted Amazon is extremely customer unfriendly these days. Instead of refunding through OPM, they refund through the gift card as if to ensure customers have to use Amazon. Even getting the contact to the customer service is a pain as the link is not obvious and hidden through multiple layers. Til now, I have not yet to receive the amount due to me since it was withdrawn by Chloe, the customer service manager, from my gift card. This has been the worst experience I have with Amazon and it certainly gives me and my family reasons not to use Amazon again. "

Benjamin Button,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So about a year and a half ago I decided to get the Amazon card. Seemed like a good idea at the time until they started to compete with temu. Slowly over time I saw once great products (same name brand) go down hill. The reason why I‚Äôm giving them a one star is I bought Inflatable paddle board 9 months ago as a birthday present. It was decent so I left a 3 star review. A month later I received a letter from ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù claiming ‚Äúgive us a 5 star review with good feedback and we‚Äôll give you a $50 Amazon gift card‚Äù which had a fake post mark from Amazon HQ‚Ä¶ I tried to report it online‚Ä¶ no luck‚Ä¶ After two hours on the phone they said they‚Äôll start an investigation‚Ä¶. Nothing happened and they‚Äôre still selling paddle boards‚Ä¶ What happens when somebody goes down a river, in the middle of a lake or in the ocean and the cheap product breaks (not counting fraud). What these (primarily) Chinese companies do is buy old URL‚Äôs from companies that went under then use their positive reputation but this‚Ä¶ This could (if it hasn‚Äôt already) resulted in death‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm basically locked in because of this stupid credit card and I want to buy a house soon‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre basically‚Ä¶ As evil as you can get‚Ä¶"

Tim Othy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has shown a complete inability to meet any delivery estimate. $500 item is now 4 days late.Was lied to by customer support saying the package was on a truck 3 days ago.

Gale McKiddy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I order often from Amazon, and have usually had success when I have spoken directly to customer service, but I dislike using their computer chats. My gripe is that they do nothing about the sellers who are selling substandard items and misrepresenting them in the item descriptions. Sellers ON PURPOSE omit things like accurate measurements, weights and details that are important. There is too much junk from China and there are too many fake reviews. The company obviously wants to make money more than monitoring their quality and seller honesty. Much of the clothing items for women are cheap and mis-sized. Lately I am being told to order more items for next day delivery, but that delivery is always later or delayed. I only order because it is difficult for me to get out to shop. For as much money as Amazon makes, they need to care more about honesty and eliminate scams."

I am not a 1 off.  The reviews speak for themselves.   Boycott Amazon!    "

Pure & simple, when you request a call back, you don't get connected!! The Customer service agent on chat was so incredibly slow, I found myself saying, hello, hello, long unnecessary pauses.You say you are customer centred, no your not, you seem to have made it extra difficult to contact customer services.Gone are the days when a quick call to customer services always sorted the issue out... NOT NOW!!APPAULING CUSTOMER SERVICES!! And it seems me and everyone else on here says so!!! "

Dellameria Brand,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Selling on Amazon offers huge opportunities but comes with serious challenges. One major issue? Amazon doesn‚Äôt do enough to protect sellers from fake reviews. Competitors often post false reviews to damage your brand and sales, and when you report it, Amazon rarely investigates or takes action.The marketplace is highly competitive, and unfortunately, some sellers play dirty, manipulating reviews to harm others or boost their own products. This creates an unfair playing field and leaves honest sellers struggling to compete.Amazon needs to step up verify reviews, take reports seriously, and create a fairer system. Until then, selling on Amazon can feel like more of a battle than a business opportunity."
James Reilly,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I just canceled my account on Amazon because the agent refused to budge on $.02. I had an order but was two cents shy and was denied a pass by the agent and to make matters worse he tried to get me to buy prime. Being a veteran and senior and having a credible record with Amazon meant nothing. I canceled.

Call Amazon Customer service and complain. They don't care. You wait months for an item, they don't deliver. Also, recently I see prices in Amazon higher than on stores.

Mark I,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is becoming more of a joke everyday. I pay for prime membership for the ""supposed"" convenience of next day deliveries, free shipping and etc. however I cannot count how many times their drivers have delivered orders to the incorrect address, snap a picture and send it to me to simply confirm they're clueless, careless and apparently incompetent of simply delivering a package to the proper address.Other times, I've paid for ""advertised"" next day deliveries that sometimes never come; have to go through an automated bot that asks irrelevant questions before I can get someone on the line to address the issue.It's even more insulting when I pay ""extra"" for an overnight delivery that never comes or goes to another address and be told I have to wait another day or 2 before something can be done. But I don't recall them waiting a day or 2 to take my money for the order.Amazon and the subsidary ""GOOGLE"" should spend less time focusing on technology that invades folks privacy and more time getting their crap together.Truly worthless"

Brittany Durio,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have been delivering for Amazon flex for the past year. I went to my normal scheduled block for 1/19/25 at 5:15pm-9:15pm I get there and it‚Äôs a crowd as always I get in line to check in give my license to the Amazon rep and waited. The rep gave my license to a stranger mistakenly instead of me which I had to go retrieve on my own. I go back to the rep they give me packages but the app shows I am not checked in so I call Amazon flex customer service like normal protocol they advised that I would be paid and my standings wouldn‚Äôt  be affected and to return the packages and leave so I did. The next day I receive a email saying I won‚Äôt be paid after doing all due diligence so I called them only to be met by a foreigner who can‚Äôt tell me anything. I shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for something that was way out of my control. It‚Äôs caused a huge inconvenience for me and I still have yet to be compensated.
LM,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had an account with Amazon Germany for more than 20 years.In September 2024 I received a tangible benefit from my company worth a couple of thousand USD which I decided to convert into Amazon Gift Cards.One month later I redeemed the gift cards to my Amazon account to purchase some kitchen stuff. I shipped it to my German address whereas my billing address was in Switzerland. A couple of days later I officially imported it to Switzerland for private use (documents were available).Soon thereafter Amazon Germany locked my account without any warning nor providing a detailed reasoning. I conducted more than 100 calls with the Customer Service to understand what information their compliance department needs to unlock the account - unfortunately without any success. At the end the Customer Service acknowledged they cannot help neither understanding their own gift card policy nor the commentaries from compliance.I sent multiple documents to Amazon based on pure speculation - among them some screenshots from Workhuman who issued the giftcards proving that I am the owner of the cards. Workhuman is a business customer with Amazon so well known. But my documentation was ignored and finally Amazon closed my account. Under EU regulation customers are allowed to approach digital companies for an online dispute resolution. But this was also rejected by Amazon.At the end I lost a thousand USD in gift cards and access to my Kindle library built over 20 years.Amazon Germany claims they want to become the most customer friendly company in the world. They have some way to go to achieve these goals. Here my very personal observations:- The Customer Service is extremely friendly with no waiting lines, and they take time listening to you. But they are not able to help you interpreting the Amazon General Terms and Conditions- Departments seem to work in silos as compliance/account specialists were not approachable by the Customer Service any time- Ticketing System is not working properly. Issues had to be explained many times from scratch. Previous communication was often lost or not followed up. Escalation was promised but without any effect- Feedback System seems biased. Survey links are shared occasionally after promising to get my account back.  I received a survey link maybe five times from about hundred calls with the Customer Service. There is no regular Net Promoter Score sent outAlthough my customer journey ended sadly I believe that Amazon is a great company and personally I own a lot of shares in Amazon."

Kathy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I gave my employees a gift of an Amazon Gift card as a reward for a job well done.  Amazon has great products & I usually have good experiences.  One individual applied the GC to a purchase and paid the balance by his personal Credit Card.  The package was never delivered.  After numerous calls, Amazon refunded his credit card but STILL HAS NOT refunded his Gift card back.  It was worth $100.  I am embarrassed that he has to continue to fight with Amazon to get his remaining $100 back - and I put him in this position by rewarding him with a gift card to your establishment.  The money, in the form of a gift card is rightfully his as Amazon did not deliver the merchandise.   I expect Amazon to do the right thing.  My company gives out many Amazon gift cards as prizes.  I'd hate to have to find another company to use in this capacity.  Order placed 11/11/24.  Order #111-8435971-7592248."

Dugan MacKenzie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Changed phone number. Called Customer Support in India. They absolutely can not help at all. Only 2-step is by phone # they have on file. No option for email verification just like Trustpilot does. Turned on CCV camera aimed at person in India to find out they don't even have computers! They read from papers. All they can help with is returns. Nothing else. Got lucky and they sent me to support in Alabama. Lady was super there and went into my account and changed to my current phone#. DID NOT HELP. So I was supposed to get into the website but I can't at all. I have a passcode, Amazon lost it also. Now I get error that I can't get in for 30 DAYS because I tried to get in thinking lady in Alabama had put in my correct phone#, she did but it STILL COMES UP WITH MY OLD PHONE# FOR THE OTC CODE. Now it shut me out completely because I tried to log in too many times. Only during help on the phone. Cleared browser data, everything, did Restart and still can only get in by 2-step to a phone that the number no longer exists. I'm completely locked out and I've been in IT since 1991. I called India twice more to get support from Alabama and both times they hung up the phone on me in India, when I was super nice.Whether you get a refund depends on the individual seller, so look at their ratings. Got some Horizon Shelf Stable Milk and when it arrived the outside and inside boxes where all broken and the cartons bashed in. The outer box fell completely apart and Amazon delivery left it at my doorstep with the small cartons all over my front door area out of the box. I sent pictures, the delivery guy did not take a picture because he didn't want any proof. I sent pictures and asked for refund or resend from seller. NOPE. They told me to go **** ******! Incredible. BTW, ALL OF THE GOOGLE REVIEWS FOR AMAZON ARE FAKE! Do a Google Search just on where you can leave Amazon Reviews and ALL of the results are how Amazon deletes its negative reviews. Nothing on where you can leave your own review. I was having Weis Market food delivered by Amazon, Weis has its own cart inside the Amazon website. Weis is great store, the problems are all the fault of Amazon. Was making a slow cooker meal to survive the snow and 8 items were not delivered. The most important ones like the chicken thighs. I used it enough to be certain that about 30% of what Amazon lists as in stock and available is NOT. THE AMAZON PEOPLE THAT GO INTO WEIS MARKET, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU BUY RAW CHICKEN TAKE ALL OF THE OLD PRODUCE WITH EXPIRATION DATES THAT ARE BEFORE THE DELIVERY DATE! And they use only one store in Damascus for the whole DC, VA, MD area. So if you order at 6AM, your delivery comes at 8PM to 10PM where I live in Rockville, MD. Did I say in the last 2 months Amazon lost my password to log in 8 times? And lost my Passcode. NOW THEY TELL ME I CAN NOT LOG IN FOR A MONTH. I HAVE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES EVERY DAY FOR 2 WEEKS!  A LADY IN ALABAMA SUPPORT ENTERED MY NEW PHONE# INTO MY ACCOUNT BUT THE PHONE# THEY USE FOR 2-STEP VERIFICATION, THEY CALL OTC, IS MY OLD PHONE# AND THEREFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT. THEY KEEP YOUR PROFILE PHONE# SEPARATE FROM THE PHONE# THAT THEY USE FOR 2-STEP VERIFICATION. TODAY I WAS TOLD I HAD TO WAIT FOR A MONTH. SO I CANCELLED PRIME AND ALL MY AUTOSHIPS BY PHONE. EACH PERSON WHO TRIED TO GET ME INTO MY OWN ACCOUNT TOLD ME LIES, WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT. I SENT A ""TECHNICAL"" DEPT AN UPLOAD OF MY DRIVER'S LICENSE AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN MY ACCOUNT IN 24 HOURS. THEIR ""TECH"" DEPT JUST SENT ME A CANNED EMAIL OF HOW TO UPLOAD MY DRIVERS LICENSE, WHICH I HAD ALREADY DONE. SO I HAVE WASTED PROBABLY 48 HOURS TOTAL ON THE PHONE WITH THEM AND ABSOLUTELY NO RESOLUTION. IN A MONTH I AM SURE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET INTO MY ACCOUNT EITHER. AND I CAN'T GET IN TO DELETE IT EITHER.RESOLUTION FOR EVERYONE: ANYTIME YOU CHANGE PHONE NUMBERS YOU HAVE TO FIRST GO INTO YOUR AMAZON ACCOUNT AND TURN OFF 2-STEP VERIFICATION, WHAT THEY CALL SENDING AN OTC CODE. CALL AND MAKE SURE IT IS TURNED OFF. YOU CAN'T KNOW YOUR NEW PHONE# TO CHANGE IT IN YOUR ACCOUNT BEFORE IT'S TO LATE. EVEN IF YOU DID, YOU WILL END UP THE SAME AS ME BECAUSE THE PHONE NUMBER YOU CAN CHANGE IN YOUR ACCOUNT IS NOT THE SAME PHONE# THEY USE TO SEND OTC CODES!!! THEY ARE STILL SENDING THE CODE TO #719, WHEN IT HAS BEEN CHANGED IN MY PROFILE TO A PHONE# THAT ENDS IN 210. THE CODES ALWAYS GO TO MY OLD PHONE# THAT DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE. THERE IS NO SOLUTION FOR THIS!!! HOPE THIS HELPS, TURN OFF 2 STEP VERIFICATION BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SEND YOUR OTC CODE TO YOUR OLD PHONE#"

Darren,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I just had the absolute worst customer experience of my life‚Äîand I need to make this clear: this is completely unacceptable.First, I discovered I‚Äôm being charged for two Prime accounts, which is already absurd. When I called to resolve it, I requested to cancel the one I don‚Äôt use, only to be told that because there was a single delivery on that account, I‚Äôm not eligible for a refund of the Prime charge. Seriously? That‚Äôs my money being wasted on a duplicate service I didn‚Äôt want or need.But it gets worse. The item I supposedly ordered through that account? I never even received it! And yet, the representative refused to issue me a refund for that as well. So now, I‚Äôm out double‚Äîcharged for a Prime subscription I didn‚Äôt want and for an order that never arrived.To make matters even more infuriating, I spent 32 painful minutes on the phone with not one, not two, but three different people. The last one, a supervisor, was so astonishingly rude and dismissive that it left me stunned. That person doesn‚Äôt just lack basic customer service skills; they should be fired immediately.This entire experience has left me feeling completely disrespected, ignored, and cheated. How can a company this large justify such incompetence and mistreatment? I expect accountability, immediate resolution, and above all, an apology for this debacle."

Then, they stalled the package, combined it with an order placed two weeks after the first.  Dealing with Amazon is frustrating at best.  Their listing will often show other alternatives price-wise, then when you click on the link, you can't find the lower price they listed.  Also, they often fail to clearly disclose arrival times and often miss arrival times, which is very frustrating when one is ordering a gift or medical/health related products for my sixteen plus year old dog.

When customers have complaints they red flag you, like they would in a Communist country, like the one my family feed.they want customers to take it and dare not speak up. I am convinced that these Chinese companies have realized how customer comments effective sales, so I no longer trust comments. There is NO WAY there could be hundreds of positive comments on products that are clearly garbage. Please beware! Amazon doesn‚Äôt care that maybe the rotten reviews are due to the subquality level . Even more concerning is the strong chemical smell many of Amazons products, out of China, have. When I have asked what it is, they have ended my chat sessions.

I was finally told two days ago that, despite all of the runaround and constant misinformation, and request after request for me to send more and more information in (multiple ID verifications, claim forms), that I was not able to receive a refund past the deadline, which is appalling, considering I have talked to SO MANY reps over the last 5 months, and nobody told me that I was past any deadline. It is AMAZON's fault that any ""deadline"" had passed with all of the hoops I have been asked to go through. I returned ALL of the items, have proof of the returns, and that is all you should've needed to refund the money that is owed to me. Period.I'm done. So, I am filing a legal claim."
Meg,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon sent me an email telling me they couldn't verify my card for the purchase and so it was declined. I repurchased with a different card. Received both orders. Amazon refused to refund me for one of the orders despite it being a mistake on their end. I had all the product in its original packaging ready to go back. Terrible customer service from the Amazon retailer
Martin Shelley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"0 stars should be a option. Amazon is wonderful until you need to return an item that they have delivered incorrectly. Unpackage the item to discover its a cheaper model inside. The only way to return is via next working day collection that you have to wait in all day for, or pay to have it returned by your own method. Customer service and help on this issue was zero just hide behind the online chat.So word of caution everything is great until its not and don't expect Amazon to help"
Tetiana Godovanets,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, I‚Äôm so fed up with this.When you choose a membership and pay a significant amount for it, you expect decent service. I‚Äôve been polite, not abusing the return policy, and understanding when things don‚Äôt go as planned. But Amazon has been taking advantage of that patience, and it‚Äôs getting out of hand.How many times have I ordered something specifically because it says ‚Äúdelivery tomorrow,‚Äù only for it to show up days later? I let it slide the first time, the second, the third, the fourth‚Ä¶ but now it‚Äôs beyond acceptable. Amazon Prime is not cheap, and when I pay for a service, I expect it to deliver as promised.Please, be realistic about your capabilities. If you‚Äôre going to deliver a product the day after tomorrow, don‚Äôt mark it as ‚Äúdelivery tomorrow.‚Äù It‚Äôs misleading and only leads to disappointment. My patience with Amazon is hanging by a thread.If I choose a product marked for next-day delivery, it‚Äôs because I need it urgently. If I knew it would take days to arrive, I would have chosen a different product. How is this fair? Enough with the lies!If this happens one more time, I will cancel my membership, and you can forget about seeing any more of my money‚Äîwhether for Prime or any of your products. I‚Äôve had enough"

TC Mann,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Some products are fine, but many are poor quality or even mis advertised with descriptions bearing no resemblance to the product being sold. Delivery is another major issue, with excessive timescales, even for Prime items. Drivers who think customer instructions are to be ignored simply dump packages in gardens etc where thieves can take them, then call it ""delivered"".  Foreign CS chat agents don't read info provided leading to frustration for customers. Often same items can be found cheaper elsewhere. Amazon survive on size alone, win some lose some!"

Mary Johnson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"To start, I have given Amazon many chances to fix the issues they have, but to no avail; we still face the same problems. I ordered work boots for my husband because he had worn down his pair. I double-checked everything and ordered the pair he asked for. Once ordered Amazon said that they would be here at my home on the 9th of January. I ordered them on the 5th of January. The 9th came and I was told there was a delay because they had sent them over to the USPS to deliver. In USPS care the boots were misplaced and delivery was delayed until the 14th of January. Then I received notice that the boots would be delivered on the 11th of January. Which in fact they were but after 7 pm that night. My husband tried them on, and they were too big for his feet. I got online on the 13th of January and set up the return. I went to UPS that same morning after they opened and sent the boots back. The boots have been in their facility since the 14th of January and still I am waiting for them to process my return. I have been told that I have to wait up to 30 days for that to happen. They say it can take up to 30 days. These boots were not cheap, and I am without that money. It may have been my mistake to order the boots online, but this should not be the process of receiving your money especially when the item is in Amazon's possession and has been for days. If I were to go to a brick-and-mortar store, I would have already had the money in hand or back to my card. I dislike speaking with Customer Service because they have no idea how to handle customers in any form. It should not take them 30 days to process a refund. It should not take them 2 weeks to process a refund when it is expected to be shipped and received in 3 days at most. It is already a process to return funds to a credit card or a debit card of 3 to 5 business days so now you are extending that further by taking 14 days to process the return. Amazon needs to change because this is not okay and definitely makes me want to take my business to other places. "

Phillip Ellis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was an Amazon  customer way back when Jeff Bezos had hair and not a supermodel insight. But 16 years loyal shopping counts for nothing in the U.K when you are locked out of your account.  I wanted to add my new phone number after my old phone headed for Africa, via West London, not with my permission. Bezos told me to go to my email to change the number. Sadly my yahoo account I joined with in 2010 had long since lapsed and so been discontinued. Therefor I had no Two-Step verification. I could not confirm my account to log back in. If you lose one of your two you are stuffed.I spent an hour on the phone to the UK call center early December. They were trained not to let you back into your account without the protocol. We both knew I was the account holder but he didn't budge. I gave him plenty of evidence of my last purchases, my ongoing Prime Video and all sorts. Thing is there is no other way to prove you own the account. In America you can send ID in and they do it that way. Not in the U.K.  I had ¬£80 worth of Amazon vouchers in there ready for the Christmas shopping. Its not theft because the vouchers are still there in the frozen account but I can only imagine just how many people like me there are out there. Needless to say its Temu time. I just cant understand why they dont want to fix this issue. I decided to join an ongoing legal class action to get my money out, 3,432 in that particular one. Make sure your email and phone number are up to date or they will fluk you."
Julian,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate that Amazon is a massive company and that very often the items bought are supplied by a third party but.....I ordered three items on Friday 10th January and immediately after placing the order, I got confirmation that two of the items would be delivered on Monday 12th and the third item on Thursday 16th.  Sorted, well I thought so, until I received a text message on Saturday afternoon, alerting me to the imminent delivery of one of the items.  Then on Sunday, a further text to tell me the second item (both of these were destined for Monday delivery) would be delivered that afternoon.  So given that text reminders appear to be the order of the day, I awaited for a text to tell me of the arrival of the third item.  It never arrived, nor did the package scheduled for Thursday, so here I am on Friday morning, trying to determine where my ¬£100 package is, only to find, on Amazon, that it was delivered on Wednesday.  I checked down a side alley and there it was, a cardboard box sat in the mist and drizzle for two days.  No notification of impending arrival, no note through the door telling me it's round the corner.People work their schedules around known facts, that makes for a easier life.  But when Amazon tell you ""deliveries will be on Monday and Thursday"", you can rightly get a little miffed when they arrive on Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday. N.B.  The delivery without notification was delivered by Yodel."

Many products are knock offs, and nearly all made in China with subpar materials. The search engine doesn't always give correct results, and often recycles the same items even with a more detailed search request.  Ideally, they should clearly identify country of origin (add a flag to the product pictures) and fine tune the search engine. I did give it a 3 because they are fairly good at returns/exchanges."

The company is admitting they sold a fake shoe to me by it not passing authentication on return. I am not entitled to a refund of the over $300 I paid for the shoes.

Jack Quinn,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Don't really know where to start with all this. For starters, when they deliver something to me, it just gets dumped in front of my front door with no concern for it being safe. They also don't bother knocking to let anyone in the house know that they are there - additionally I don't get a delivery photo either. My most recent experience has been an utter nightmare. Ordered a monitor and keyboard - paid for next day as well - came to delivery day and the delivery was ""delivered"" to a neighbour. Didn't think much of it until I went over to the neighbour found that my delivery was nowhere to be seen but the neighbour's delivery, dumped on the ground for anyone to jus take. So then I start with customer service. Explain the problem, and the response I get is to ""File a Police Report"" - refusing to help in any other way until I do this. I call the police about it, explain the issue, they explain countless amounts of people have had this same problem - says that its Amazon's fault and that they need to start internally investigating and say that its on them for the delivery issue. Go back to customer service about it - say the same thing over and over that ""I need a Police Report"" for them to do anything.Safe to say after all this, I'm never shopping at Amazon again. Never used to be like this, don't know what happened. AVOID THEM."

Sherry Rice,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I dont know what is happening with Amazon but the promises made in terms of when to receive an order seems to be a sham or bait and switch type manuever.  For example, I see a merchandise and it will indicate the item will be received on a certain day but once I place the order the date changes to three days later.  Or the promise is to receive the order between 4:00 am and 8:00am and then time passes and I get a message; ""Delayed it has not shipped, we will let you know"".  The return policy is even worse.  You have to go to three different places to return items that you ordered at the same time.  For example if I ordered six items, and returning three out of the six, one has to be returned to UPS Store, Kohl's or Staples.  Ridiculous.  Also UPS is now charging a $1.00 to return some items.  I used to get an automatic credit when I return an item--now it is taking over a week and not able to get a status on the refund.

Winter Revan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Used to be great, nothing but a sad joke now. I‚Äôve been using them for over a decade, looking for a better option nowüíØThe return policy keeps getting worse by the minute. Prime Video subscription going up while offering less and less services, nickel and dime all the way. Almost impossible to get customers service representative that can speak clearly or even know their job or the services they provide.The problems with this platform keep multiplying, so are the service charges."
HellenAlice,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I received excellent assistance from their customer service representatives when some items I had purchased were missing (I had two incidents). The representative explained the process, and I got a clear understanding of what to expect, i.e., whether I should place another order or get a refund. They also guided me on how to enhance my delivery instructions to avoid similar incidents in the future. I commend the level of training Amazon provides to its customer service team. Since then, deliveries have been on point."

YoN_SuN,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon - is the most PROBLEMATIC site I ever had registered to.First of all, you create an account, then, I'm having big problems forgetting the password.I have ALL the info to change my password: gmail, phone number, username, BUT! It won't help.Some sort of ""protective system"", after me trying to recieve a code to my gmail then after writes: ""Oh uh! Sorry! No! You won't get the access! You are sus!"", not literally that's what was written there, but, similar to this.Not only this, after I wanted to get my account back, they asked for my passport. I gave my passport, and then, a phew minutes after, my account was deleted. No answer, no warning, just right after got deleted.And there was nothing bad in the passport, country is Israel, 19 years old, what else could've get wrong?So basically, because all of these problems, that's a solid 1 star out of 5. Thank you."
Valerie Hicks,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They deserve ZERO stars. 2 day delivery is a thing of the past, many of my items keep getting rerouted to USPS who cannot deliver direct to my house and I have to get it fixed with them, many times deliveries are on hold for ridiculous reasons and if I have to request a refund there have been times I have had to contact customer service multiple times over a few weeks and they still botch it even after saying to expect my refund within 24 hours. What was once promised as next day or 2 day shipping now easily averages 5 days. Had my subscription for about 5 years now, not worth it anymore. The worst part is not only do they refuse to refund my gift card balance even before shutting down my account totalling to over $100, but all Kindle books, audiobooks and movies that I purchased outright are completely inaccessible. Customer service will lie outright and tell you they will be or that they are handling an issue, but don't believe it. They are worse than TEMU now."
C. A,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Okay I'm over Amazon and about to drop my account. $185 for ridiculousness. I received 2 Christmas gifts that I needed to return, Amazon claims gift giver won't know BUT..I returned one gift and I never received the refund in my Amazon account (which they claim that's how you get your refund) and a few weeks passed no refund to my or the gift purchasers account..50 min chat session w/someone w/limited comprehension of my language (english) and she then says she will refund to my Amazon charge account..Well the gift giver got the refund in a gift card balance in her account. Now trying to return the other gift and it's only giving me return options that are to far from my residence or to a place where I need a printer to print a label instead of the normal drop it off at Whole Foods or Khols..So an hour trying to get an answer on why, I spoke to  3 different ladies who all have limited English making it extremely hard to understand and one girl is at home and sounds like I'm on speaker phone making it even harder to comprehend her thick accent. Amazon for the millions you make off us sucker's who pay you $185 per year to get free (now) 2 or 3 day shipping you'd think you'd employ a few customer services phone centers in the USA too. Your chat is useless seeing its just AI and calling for a simple question should not entail your AI sending me a text, email or Amazon Ap when I'm on the phone. Ridiculous! Make returning unwanted gifts easier already what a f'n joke!"
John Williams,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Pay alot for amazon prime. My prime one day order is sitting in warehouse in my city was told to wait 2 more days.

Taylor Siena,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,5 stars excellent customer service and support 
Simon A,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I received the worst customer service after I found fraudulent activity on my account. After seeing a random outgoing amount to Amazon I called them and we established it was an unauthorised purchase. They confirmed someone had tried to order multiple items, none of which with my delivery address details. They were supposed to sort this out as a matter of urgency, refund my money and promised various callbacks which didn't happen. After waiting days after days and receiving no updates I ended up calling back numerous times and I was repeatedly fobbed off and given no help what so ever. On one call I asked to speak to a manager, I was placed on hold for a while, eventually the same agent came on and said the manager refused to take my call and I had to call back another time...what sort of service is that to a victim of fraud?? Absolutely disgraceful and that person should be disciplined at least, probably sacked in my opinion. In the end I have pursued this fraud via my bank in the hope they can help, so far much better than Amazon who don't seem to take this kind of thing seriously. It wasn't a small amount of money either, it was a significant amount which obviously I hadn't budgeted for which pushed me to my overdraft. It's shame as I have been with Amazon for years, spent ¬£1000's probably over that time, this is the first issue I have had and they were not there to help or provide any sort of service with what I consider is a serious matter, it is a criminal matter at the end of the day. I won't be shopping with them again, there are plenty of other retailers out there who offer the same products and at similar prices who I would rather give my custom to."
Sandy Fullbrook,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Delivery service disgusting they don't even knock but leave on door step for anyone to steal and it's so difficult to complain to amazon u need a A level to understand how 
Holli Kendall,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Delivery times are increasingly delayed.  Being a Prime member means nothing for delivery. 2 day delivery is frequently 5 or more days. Usually it doesn‚Äôt matter to me but sometimes it does and if I cannot get the item in the stated delivery time I need to go buy it in person somewhere. Amazon also pulls the bait and switch, stating one delivery time when ordering and completely changing it by the time you complete the order. Packages are lost and orders cannot be cancelled until after package is eventually received, which us unknowable. Obviously they have such a policy because they know you are unlikely to return once item is in your hands. Amazon is in over their heads. Don‚Äôt promise what you cannot deliver. I make purchasing decisions based on delivery time. I feel used and cheated when delivery is changed, especially when it changes multiple times such that I have idea when the package may arrive. It is disrespect for my time. In addition, the reviews are not trustworthy, as there appear to be increasingly more fake and paid for, suspect reviews. I have had some of my critical reviews removed for supposed policy violations even when no rules were broken. I am fed up! I will NOT be renewing membership again. "
Terry Parsons,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered delivery for delivery next day to lockers 5 days later they arranged replacement as only way to change address.1 item I got refunded this item getting today rest be tomorrow even though I was promised delivery of all products.

Fireball XL5,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After paying for next day delivery for an item i needed the tracking said it was attempted to be delivered. The item was not attempted to be delivered as i was watching on the app from when it stated it was 8 stops away and could clearly see if a driver was even in the area. After speaking to customer support today they stated the package didn't go back to the warehouse last night I would have to wait 2 days without tracking on a package someone have to give a password for in person and I cannot get refunded until the 2 days are up.. what I can figure a driver stole the packaged and now amazon are delaying the refund 
Truth Teller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I made an online purchase yesterday.  Wanted to check the purchase couldn't get online.  Customer would NOT help me get onto my account.  They told me that one item was delivered (argued about this).  I told them I received nothing.  They said they had a photo of the item - it wasn't my apartment.  I told them I wanted a refund and to cancel the rest of my order.  They refused.  I've had issues with Amazon before but this time I will make a formal complaint against them.  This is nothing less than pure fraud.  And sadly they get away with it.  I'm not going to pay for something I never received and I don't want the rest of the order.
Chris,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have never had any problem with amazon and deliveries until today.I am home bound and I do not get out.That is why I choose to shop amazon so that it could be delivered to my home.Today, a Carrier UPS not Amazon, left some ridiculous.Text message telling me that I need to go pick up my package because they couldn't deliver it to my home.Which is absolutely ridiculous when I was sitting right here when they were there.Never received a text never received anything I then went to call customer service.And the woman said the best she can do.Was to try to call UPS customer service.When she came back on the line, she told me.It was a twenty two minute away which I had already waited over forty minutes on the u p s line before I called Amazon But obviously at this point I don't even want the item that I purchased.So I will find a way to go pick the item up and then promptly return it"

Wish the seller would have said something about not being able to meet amazons time line for delivery and I wish Amazon stood by what they told me regarding refund. That day came and Amazon refused to give it. That‚Äôs ok, I have come to expect this quality of service from them and their sellers. The product itself will have to wait for me to use it.

Charlie Hamer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,On 3rd January I received an email from Amazon to say my item was being shipped. I logged into my account as wondered if this was a scam email (as I had not ordered anything). It turns out someone hacked my account and spent ¬£54.99 of my Amazon vouchers I had on my account. I called up Amazon and was told they would cancel this item and refund me the money back onto my gift card balance. I also asked for a block to be put on my account. I changed my Amazon and email passwords immediately. I was told I would be contacted by the relevant team at Amazon that deal with fraud. I received an email basically telling me to test me email etc. On 6th I went onto my Amazon and could not see a refund on my gift card balance. I then saw that another order on 6th was made on my account and payment was taken from my debit card. So I called Amazon. I was told they would contact the relevant team to cancel the item and look into my previous refund. I asked if I could talk to them directly and was told I couldn‚Äôt. I asked how this was possible that another transaction had been made when I had asked for a block to be put on my account. Apparently this was not done. After the call I removed my bank card from my saved card details. Then on 10th January someone else tried to order another item. Amazon did not cancel the item and it was delivered to whoever ordered it. I called Amazon again on 11th January and was told they would let the relevant team know. I asked I r I could speak to a manager or some at that team by phone. I was told couldn‚Äôt. I asked if I could have contact details to make a formal complaint and was told they didn‚Äôt have any. The customer service (given that fraudulent activity is happening repeatedly on my account) has been appalling. I feel your company are not taking this seriously. I am still awaiting on 2 refunds.

Courtney,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a kindle in December that ended up getting canceled after my amazon account locked me out of it because of a technical issue. I spoke to Amazon and they recommended I just order it again after the charge was dropped and I did so. The second order I placed on the first of the year and thus far, it‚Äôs been delayed twice. I spoken to countless customer service reps who assured it would be delivered by the most recent date it was updated to. The most recent delay assured me it would be delivered by 1/12 because of a supply chain issue. On both dates I was given for delivery I was charged $117. Well this morning, on the day yet again my kindle was supposed to be delivered, I received a delayed shipment email. This time however, there is not future delivery estimate attached to it and no option to cancel. I called Amazon customer service instead of chatting which unfortunately got me nowhere last time, and this time thankfully an employee was honest with me and informed me that she can‚Äôt guarantee it will be shipped anytime soon but that she would do her best to get information from the shipping department to me within 48 hours. The trouble is that I now have over $200 pending for this order which is now ‚Äústuck‚Äù as I was told and canceling this order through my Amazon account has not been successful. So now I have to wait and either it gets delivered soon or I contact Amazon again to get them to cancel this order and release the funds to my account before going to find it in store rather that hoping it gets delivered this time. Now normally, increased shipping times wouldn‚Äôt bother me, but the prospect of potentially have several hundred dollars tied up every time they update the delivery date, only to not receive the item because it wasn‚Äôt actually shipped it incredibly irritating. And unfortunately Amazon has not indicated these increased shipping times on the items page when looking at the ‚Äúexpected date of delivery‚Äù. Mind you, I did receive another item I ordered from Amazon only days ago that was shipped two days after placing which was also fulfilled by Amazon. So just be aware that there may be a delay when placing your order. I live in a very large city, so it‚Äôs not an issue of logistics. And a couple of the big box stores around me do have kindles in stock. But I‚Äôm now stuck in limbo waiting on this product to finally ship or be canceled. And I tried posting this review to Amazon after Amazon afforded me the option despite never delivering anything to me and I received an email ten minutes later informing me that my review couldn‚Äôt be posted because it mentioned delivery time, shipping, cost, etc‚Ä¶.

Dream Ytf,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Shopping on Amazon has become a frustrating experience. Every return and refund needs to be closely monitored to ensure you actually receive the money you‚Äôre promised. When one of my orders was lost during delivery, I was advised to cancel it, and the status showed ‚Äúrefund issued‚Äù ‚Äî but the money never appeared in my account. Despite contacting customer service multiple times, each representative assured me the issue had been resolved, which it hadn‚Äôt. It took five attempts before I finally received my refund. Since then, I‚Äôve kept a closer watch on refunds, only to find three more instances where I didn‚Äôt get the money owed to me. Once again, I had to reach out repeatedly, encountering misleading responses from customer service. The entire process has been exhausting, and if you can avoid shopping on Amazon, do yourself a favor ‚Äî it‚Äôll save you a lot of unnecessary hassle."

Alkyoni V.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon used to offer the best customer experience but now is the worst ever. I returned an item and they promised to refund me a month ago. I have contacted them six times since then as I never received a refund. Each time they say they will refund me and that I should wait 7 days. Then of course they don‚Äôt refund me and when I contact them again they say the same story again. Now they don‚Äôt even respond to emails and they drop out of the chat messages without solving the problem. This is the worst customer service ever. I am speechless. I will not be buying any stuff from Amazon again. I guess they will never refund me for this product. I don‚Äôt know which authorities protect consumers. It seems this is Amazon‚Äòs downfall. Shame.

customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Two recent incidents have made me hesitant to continue purchasing from Amazon.1- a very inexpensive item ($7) was obviously lost in transit, however Amazon wants me to upload my government ID into their system before I can get my refund. This must be a new policy but I‚Äôm not comfortable doing that. I‚Äôd rather loose $7 that upload my ID!2- Amazon driver delivered my item to the wrong house and took a picture of the wrong door. Amazon knew this but still made me fill out multiple forms before I finally got my refund weeks later.Amazon‚Äôs new policies are going to push many customers away. Is good for me in a way because I was spending too much with them anyway."
Tammy Duncan,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I bought my daughter boots for Christmas.  I bought them early because I was trying to get everything in before Christmas.  I‚Äôm on a budget so I buy a little at a time.  The boots I got were the wrong ones.  I didn‚Äôt know there is a return window even on Christmas.  Then they told me they would refund me my money twice.  That was a lie.  Period.  Then they said as a courtesy they would allow me to return them but I will have to drive an hour away to return them.  And they are only refunding a portion of what I spent.  I‚Äôm sorry but I would think Amazon could do better especially after all they did to me in this situation.   I‚Äôm making this post to share what can happen. Please be aware.  I want to share that I reached out one last time and got the right person.  They refunded me the cost of the boots and I was able to purchase the ones she wanted.  Yay.  But still please know about the return/refund policy.   If you have suggestions for how to prevent this at Christmas please reply to review.

Mark ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Delivery drivers just dump parcels on the door step. They don't knock and when parcels get stolen amazon will accuse you of fraud because of their own sheer incompetence.When they email to ask why so many refunds and you tell them, they say they cannot discuss it further.I will keep claiming the refunds. Absolute joke. My advice is to take it out on the drivers.No stars at all should be an option."

ambani,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I've bought from Amazon many times and usually have great experiences, but this time was a bit of a mixed bag. The product I ordered was decent but didn't quite live up to the quality I was expecting. It works fine for the most part, but the finish was a little rough. Shipping was a bit slower than usual, and I had to wait a few extra days. Customer service did respond quickly when I reached out, but the overall experience didn't blow me away. It's an okay purchase, but I'm not entirely thrilled."

Simeon Owens,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,How does Amazon say your package is out for delivery for two days? When asked you get it will be delivered today.

Katie Sinnott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"AVOID AMAZON AT ALL COST. Taking matters in to my own hands because Amazon are doing nothing to help absolute joke. I will be deleting my Amazon account and will never be shopping with them again. On Monday the 6th of January I received multiple emails in the early hours of the morning, these were order confirmations saying that multiple separate products have been purchased through my account. Thinking my account had been hacked I immediately checked my bank account and over ‚Ç¨300 had been taken, I immediately logged in to my Amazon account and my account looked fine upon immediate glance, I checked my order history and the last order record was an order I placed myself on November 14th. HOWEVER When I selected ‚ÄòHelp‚Äô at the bottom of the page then selected ‚Äòunknown charges‚Äô then ‚Äòtransactions‚Äô you can suddenly see all the charges that have come out of my account and the products that were purchased. I DID NOT PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS and I also find it very strange that they don‚Äôt show up in my order history but some how order confirmations were all sent to my email??? My home address is saved to my account and it is an Irish address, each product had an address of somewhere in the United Kingdom (they don‚Äôt even look like real addresses). I have tried to contact Amazon in multiple ways to get this problem fixed it‚Äôs an absolute joke. I got one email reply from them saying they can‚Äôt find any suspicious activity through my account! Seriously??!! Ive had to cancel my bank card in fear of more money being taken, I tried to cancel these orders immediately and Amazon said they could not cancel them. All week I have been receiving dispatch emails and emails showing the parcels being delivered!!! I just received an email this evening from Amazon thanking me for a review i made through my account on a book I apparently purchased through my account??!! I have NEVER left a review on Amazon and there isn‚Äôt even any history of this book ever being purchased through my account! I‚Äôve no bank details saved on my account, I have changed passwords, done everything I possible can, either someone is still hacking in to my account or there‚Äôs something seriously wrong happening behind the scenes with Amazon but I will never be trusting their website ever again. And if someone has actually hacked my account, ordered these products, robbed my money and accepted these parcels from the delivery driver you should be ashamed of yourselves. I have screen shots of everything, the products, the delivery addresses, even a photo sent to my email address of someone accepting one of the parcels at their front door. "
Dave McArthur,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a 75"" Sony Smart TV from Amazon. This was no inexpensive TV. I was given a delivery date of 01/09/2025 between the hours of 8 AM and 11 AM EST. At 10 AM on 01/09/2025 I received a call from Amazon telling me that the delivery would be delayed until 01/16/2025. One hour before the TV was scheduled to be delivered! What kind of a company does that? Even if they had told me a day in advance, I would have been disappointed but a least it would have been fairly reasonable notice. I contacted Amazon customer service and they really could care less. Amazon has been going down hill for a while now, and this just shows how unprofessional they have become. I canceled the order and will be cancelling all of my Amazon subscriptions. At this rate I expect Amazon go go bankrupt in the next few years."

The Christmas cards I bought for my family were beautiful and different. They were pop-ups that lit up and played music.  My family loved them. Now I also discovered groceries and I love it.  They deliver fast and the fresh fruits and vegetables are always great.  
This Happened,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Used to love Amazon uk and now really dislike the company ethos. Admittedly It is still better than some to sort out a problem but you have to get through the ai  assistant to get to the hidden real staff, the replies are so generic from the staff though and full of over the top things like they have your back and such like, its not like they mean it! also you can easily be fobbed off with told the warehouse to fast track it / they will never let it happen again etc,  to no avail .The main issue we have with amazon now is even in prime you mostly have to buy an item with no delivery date on it, it will often say in stock but no date - then you  have to wait for a date of arrival which could be in a day (very very unlikely) or week but also a month later you can be waiting, this has been the case often  - sitting on items for many weeks and then the estimated date is  between tomorrow or a month it will quote! so a customer has no idea until it is out for delivery, and that may not suit many.(we once tried redelivery button on amazon to get a large size item to come same time as another large size item the same and instead one got lost or delayed if i remember rightly - i do know we now wont use that button! )Prime reading now has very few magazine titles compared to what it used to and we have seen items rrp change and the price/savings with it! ie a Philips buzzard lamp that was always around ¬£20-¬£26 approx. started in the last few months being in a discount at times at about ¬£57 and was often as high as about ¬£70 . Really poor and although i don't see amazon going anywhere for the foreseeable I do see there market dominance changing in time as I love the opportunity for us here to give others the business because of amazons arrogance. I also hear how prime has never delivered parcels faster - where???? as they have never been slower than they have been the past few months, around xmas it picked up but I will not be surprised to see it slow and of course still mostly no dates are given. So different to the beginning of amazon.How are amazon allowed to say shipping in prime is 1-2 days when it is easily way longer and has mostly been for ages with some around xmas exceptions. All the guaranteed by xmas badges of the past were missing this year. Disappointing. This was written January 2025 - the review experience date is about when we first noticed a drop off in delivery dates. "
TERRI,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I had Amazon prime through MetroPCS I'm supposed to still have it I pay $160 a month to MetroPCS.  Normally I would pay $130 a month can I pay the extra so I get my Amazon prime and I don't have to mess around with paying Amazon.  Now they suspended my prime for an absolutely no reason I did nothing wrong at all I need one of them say the other it's suspended it so I can't get it straightened out so I'm paying all this extra money for nothing.

Maxine McLeod,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I got a new kindle tablet for a Christmas gift. I was so excited. This one will be my 6th Kindle. I then bought 256 GB extra space on a one of those little SanDisk. I waited until the disk arrived before I used my tablet. When I was ready to register my tablet  it said my password was incorrect. I asked to change my password and a box pops up that says internal error try again later. Three attempts, three failures.  I go to customer service but I can't talk to a real person. I'm not technically savvy so I need help. I type in saying xi Need to speak to tech support. A list pops up of over 3000 plus scenarios but not one is helpful! All it does is take me back to what I've already tried!  The problem is the place where I can ask for a call is a big old secret! I went thru page after page trying to find his secret page. When I finally found the page I had spent hours searching and it was very late. Who wants to spend money where you can't talk with a real person when there's a problem not addressed on their help list? And who is going to scroll thru 3000+ help items to find he one you need?!! I know this one thing. When Jeff Bezos makes a purchase he doesn't scroll thru a help list of 100 let alone 3000!!  I think Jeff Bezos' customers should be afford the same privileges he's afforded when doing business with others. Why make it more difficult for your customers? Why makes bad reputation out of one that use to be so excellent?  I have been an Amazon fan when they were selling used books until now.  I'm sending my new Kindle tablet back along with the keyboard. I'm beyond frustrated by all the hoops you have to jump thru to get to a live person. It took 2 days and many hours of my time to get to speak to anyone and then I got only half the issue resolved. If Amazon has so little interest in helping its customers they can keep their tablet!  They're not the only one making tablets. I called my daughter and told her to come get the tablet and return it. I no longer want it. I'm done!"
Adeep Khan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Has Lost My TrustAmazon has become a huge disappointment.

Jackson,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I've used Amazon for many years but I'm coming on here to leave a review as they seem to be experiencing delivery issues WAY MORE frequently than in the past. I feel like 1/5 orders I'm having issues getting the package. To be honest, since I tend to place sizable (monetary) orders, I'm becoming less inclined to order from there since I'm no longer sure what to expect. Additionally, I frequently have Amazon delivery drivers throwing my packages, not knocking on the door upon delivery, or not following the delivery instructions. All in all, I am becoming increasingly displeased with the service and since they're the main platform I use for online ordering, I think it's a sign to cut back my spending. I've had better luck with AliExpress and those items are literally coming from China. I've never once had delivery issues there but Amazon is seemingly having trouble shipping within the same country. Color me confused. "
Darren C,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Don't understand why the Amazon drivers think it is fine to leave your deliveries at the foot of the front door on show to everyone and anyone waiting for them to be stolen,why not just put some effort in and place it out of sight around the side of the house.This is constant with Amazon."

KOK KEE KOO,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer for more than 20 years. What I valued most was their response to any problem. However, now, all you do, whether through email or chat, you are just communicating to an AI bot -- totally useless! I recently bought a coffe grinder based on the Amazon webpage's assurance that it will run on 220v. However, the unit delivered was rated only for 100 - 120v. In trying to resolve this problem, I had at least 20 communications with Amazon. All replied emails asked for exactly the same information which I gave on numerous occasions. Finally, a person replied asking me to return the unit. When I took the carton to the Post Office, I was informed the postage will be about US$120. I emailed asking for confirmation that I will be refunded in full for this postage as well. After many emails, repeating the same thing, I was given the assurance. HOWEVER, I just have am email from their Return Dept confirming the arrival of my return and stating that they have refunded me US$20 for the postage! I am now trying to recover the US$100 that is due to me. Mentally I am prepared for another week of going back and forth before this is resolved. Furthermore, They informed me that the refund is in the form of an Amazon Gift Card! What do I want this for when I am NEVER going to buy from Amazon again.

On top of that, they will only refund up to 90 SEK, even though the actual return cost is 172 SEK. All of this for an issue caused by the seller. It feels like Amazon is protecting the seller while placing the burden on me, the customer."
Don,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Keeps you waiting all day. Also amazon hires foreigners to work. Typical corrupt America. It is terrible how a company can be so bad. Our world is so ugly and greedy. Humans will destroy it in no time. I pity anyone who uses thus website. Getting a guy from Israel or Africa delivering it. Cause amazon and liberals won't pay Americans.

kevin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"ordered 150.00 dollar bottle of perfume on dec-20th 2024, took payment immediatly, siad item in stock with delivery between jan-2-2025 and jan-6-2025. Jan 6th comes and no tracking number and no shipping. Contact customer service and they say fulfillment center doesnt have it but no-one ever notified us just kept saying that arriving by 10pm onJan-6th. after i contacted them they said they would look into it and then all of sudden get email saying new delivery date Jan-23rd. I contact again and was told they had to get it shipped from another fulfillment center that has in stock. It shouldnt take over 2 weeks from the new fulfillment center. I wanted to cancel and they say cant until it doesnt arrive this time.They can just keep changing the delivery date whenever they want and dont care. I am a Prime member and paid for shipping and all i get offered is a $5 coupon."
John F,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Been doing business with Amazon for - very long time.  Recently bought a 62 dollar product.  Worked great for a month then didn‚Äôt work at all.  Amazon customer service told me I could not return it but I could obtain a warranty replacement if I filled out a form they provided to me. Did so.  Waited a month no replacement arrived.  Called them again and they said the same thing, fill out the form for a warranty replacement.  Did so again.  Waited another month, still nothing.  Called Amazon for the 3rd and final time and they once again told me to fill out the form.  I told them cancel my Amazon account instead.  Best decision I ever made; thank you Amazon. "

H C (Palindrome3D),Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon support is pretty helpful IF you can get ahold of them. It's a song and dance to get in touch with a live person, they make it convoluted on purpose i'm sure to avoid the influx of customer complaints and reach outs. My current issue is - Amazon offers features like ""spend $ so much and qualify for next morning delivery"" They told me if I added more to my order I would get next morning Delivery. I dont typically do this as I never need anything so bad as to have someone drive out at 7am to deliver me stuff. But this time, I did. Severely scalded my mouth to the point its agony to brush my teeth. I ordered a special toothpaste and brush to help me during this time and well it was something needed the next day. So I got tricked, added more to my order than i actually needed just to get these items to me asap. 11am January 4th came and went. The shipping info changed to ""sorry it's delayed, it'll be there by 6pm on the 5th"" It did not come.. still hasn't come yet and it's now the 6th. I check tracking and the stuff has been at my city's carrier facility since 4am  january 4th... they just havent brought it to me. So why did i spend more money to get it on the 4th if it's just going to sit in your facility? There's no way to easily reach out to anyone about this. I sent an email to the support email and  was told no, that's not the right place. I finally was able to get a human through the chat service and they said the best they can do is  get the items to me on the 7th. At least they said to reach out to them after i get them to compensate me on the delay.  But that means the song and dance of having to reach back out for something that should have just been here on the 4th. Dont offer features you can't honor just to trick us into spending more than we needed to. That's what makes me mad. What I learned is not to trust that feature.  I now do not believe you willever honor that and therefore have no reason to add more purchases just to get the perk. And I hope many other customers always are wary of said feature and stop falling prey to the scummy business tricks to get us to spend more. "
Georgia boy Videos,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They are frauds and stealing my money by forcing me to have amazon credit instead of refunding it back into my bankI returned an item a month ago, and it took almost 30 days for amazon to give me my refund. When the refund was finally issued they gave it back as amazon credit instead of back into my bank account as requested. When I talk to customer service, they keep telling me they can't give me my money back because the transfer is completed, and they're trying to put the blame back on me! They tried to say ""well you initiated the refund"" which I kept reminding them that I did so over the phone and specified I wanted the money back on my bank, so that it was Amazon's employee who wrongly put the money back in as an amazon credit. when i call them to discuss this problem, they just disconnect the call and just hangs up on me after trying to blame me for their mistake over and over again. This has to be illegal, they are denying me my own money and keep telling me ""you can spend it on amazon"" and I keep trying to tell them I need the money for stuff that I can't purchase on amazon, such as subscription services... or my phone bill, so my money is now locked away in an amazon gift card balance when I really need for non amazon purchasesStay away from amazon, their customer service has gone down and they will steal your money"
–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ù–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∏–Ω,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has become a haven for scammers. I've received counterfeit products more than once, and the platform does little to prevent it. On top of that, delivery is unbearably slow, even for Prime members. Worst of all, one of my packages wasn‚Äôt even delivered to my door, it was just left in the building elevator! Unacceptable service for such a massive company."
William Rouse,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Products are slowly but surely becoming second rate and at least 80% of the time the delivery date is pushed back. Instead of giving a legitimate delivery date they give a false expectation to help encourage you to buy from them. If a seller ships regular delivery thru USPS they ought to know it's not coming next day. I stopped doing reviews of products until I have had them for 3 months because 1/4 of them break or fall apart. Amazon needs to verify or remove some of these aweful sellers or they are in trouble. I am about done with the downhill slide
Ben ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a tall freestanding fridge ""SOLD BY AMAZON AND DELIVERED BY AMAZON"". Later, I went online to check before delivery and there was a message that the price had gone down. I spoke to a lady on the phone who said I can reorder the fridge, but she did not tell me that the other important services that were integral with the first order, such as unpacking, installation and removal of my faulty fridge had been removed but, funny enough, the extended warranty was still in force. So this was not a price decrease but a price increase. Other sellers of the same model of the fridge kept their price and still kept the services that accompanied the fridge. For me, Amazon is engaging in unacceptable ""sharp"" practice and a hidden increase in price. I am not happy. The second Amazon agent who dealt with me said he will contact the IT department. I was told by one of the agents that Amazon was the best. On this occasion, I disagree. Is Amazon ignoring the feelings of loyal customers? Hmm, the jury is out."

The item appears to have been lost by Asda and so have to wait 14 days for a refund. It would be helpful if Amazon only used companies for returns who actually give a receipt of proof of return. At least then, if a returned item is lost, it's clearly not the fault of the customer. Without a receipt, the customer has no proof that they actually returned the item. I should not have to wait 14 days for a refund because Asda appears to have lost a returned item."

Shamhan Djabaev,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I want to expose some deeply troubling practices I‚Äôve experienced with Amazon recently. They‚Äôve been canceling deliveries on buyers‚Äô behalf and falsely marking items as ‚Äòrejected by you‚Äîreturning to the seller‚Äô when that‚Äôs not true. The real issue? Amazon‚Äôs hiring delivery drivers from temporary employment agencies who seem unaccountable and untrained.Worse yet, Amazon actively blocks meaningful communication. If you try to email them, they respond with automated messages that make you think the address doesn‚Äôt work, essentially cutting off any chance to resolve issues directly. This is unacceptable for a company of Amazon‚Äôs size and influence.To stop this behavior, we need to unite and hold them accountable. Stop using Amazon and support alternative platforms. Let‚Äôs also find organizations that address these kinds of consumer rights violations. Amazon must realize that customers won‚Äôt tolerate being mistreated like this!"

This overworking leads to items not making it to their destination, items making it broken because they were hastily packed, people getting the wrong items. So then you have to spend your time doing their job as I have for the past two deliveries I've gotten from them...all while their owner doesn't pay them enough for food (they have the 3rd most employees on food stamps). So not only are you paying for shitty service, you're paying for their employees wages, while Bezos cosplays space cowboy."

John,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Normally everything is fine but for some reason not today. I bought an electrical item in the UK from them a few months ago. They are recorded as the seller on the order. The item has gone faulty. I went to the website and it says the returns window has closed. I contacted their chat service and the first one ended the conversation when I asked for a refund  (claimed that Amazon systems were down). Someone else came on and told me the return window has closed and tried to refer me to the manufacturer. But the return window is Amazons T&C's it is overridden by the UK and my contract is with the retailer (Amazon) and not with the manufacturer. Basically the ""Consumer Rights Act 2015"" gives me a right to a repair, replacement or refund by the retailer for a minimum of 6 months and potentially for up to 6 years. Amazon are seemingly wanting to act outside this law. The only redress the person on the chat could give me was to tell me to email complaints. This is in progress but they haven't replied to me three days later. I guess I am going to have to go down the legal route. Samsung did this to me once. They eventually refunded me but the consequence is that they lose future business and I tell plenty of people about it. Ah well I guess they are  too big to care.Update. Eventually I issued a small claims claim against them and they passed it to their solicitors who paid up pretty fast including the court fees."

customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"day by Christmas (Order # 112-4989353-6981043). The massage chair not even not delivered, it was not even shipped. Yesterday I was checking the website and it said I would receive it by 10/15/2025. However, the website was indicating to new customers that if they purchased it not through prime, it would be delivered by 1/10/2025 still at the discounted price. The website listed as there is only one item left. Then upon checking Amazon was listing the exact same chair for $1,499 as a prime item for delivery by January 3, 2025. I was scammed into cancelling the original order and repurchasing it for $1,499 on amazon website after spending 5 hours with Amazon chat associates and associates by phone (Order # 111-5954644-1603400). Amazon prime listed as 7 units left from this product. Amazon seems to be using a tactic to make you purchase, then delay the product and make you pay a hefty price to upgrade to prime purchase. I feel this is theft and fraud. I will report it to the federal trade commission. Amazon is now holding my purchase money from both orders. I want to cancel the second order and I want my money back. I want compensation for the delayed item. Amazon needs to conduct itself more honestly. This is a scam. "
Chris Schildt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The support you get from Amazon (US) today is what happens when we allow one company to have near-monopoly power.  Amazon prides itself on being customer centric - it's one of the core Leadership Principles they drill into every employee.  Yet when I had a recent problem they gave me a nonsense answer (they said they would add a note to my account to speed up shipping even though they told me the item had already shipped) and took no ownership to find a solution to my problem.  It was basically ""we've done what our resources can do, it's your problem to solve.""  Frustratingly, the item I had an issue with was < $10 and was the smallest item in my order - I was even willing to pay for a more expensive replacement!!  Ideally the US Government would look into Amazon (and other Big Tech) for anti-trust but unfortunately that's doubtful to happen.  In the meantime I miss the old Amazon ways and will look to buy from other companies as much as possible."
Barbara Reese,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible delivery service. Their online customer service is like robots that don't read your issue and have scripted responses. I track all of my orders especially the auto-shipments for petfood. Every time I have a delivery I watch the drivers pass by my apartment complex multiple times and then see the delivery times bumped out to much later in the day. I watch in agony as the driver gets farther and farther away. Sometimes the driver's lie and say they couldn't make the delivery because they couldn't get access. I will be finding another place to purchase my cat food.

Kaydot Origin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, Amazon is one of the worst services I've ever used. It is unbelievable how consistent something can be at being poor. Delivery attempts where not made and the tracking is awful with no information on stops or location, the app is stuck in a constant ""out for delivery"" state so its almost expected for me to just remain in all day every day until it arrives and speaking to customer support is just constant lies to appear to resolve the issue - utter waste of time. Item cost over ¬£100 and still haven't received it days later with constant communication with support agents who tell me it'll be delivered today and then the next to tell me it was never out to be delivered today and was wrong information to then eventually tell me they don't know and it'll be redelivered when its redelivered... So I have an app that is telling me a wrong status with no updates, support lying and overall utterly poor communication. Seriously need to sort their services out and being a Prime member for years, using the service constantly regardless of the poor service, really gives you nothing more in customer loyalty terms. Think its time for everyone to just avoid using them until they fix their service."
Jackie Day,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Still can find anything on Amazon. Shipping is taking longer now.
Joab,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I placed an order and after 2 weeks of waiting I decided to cancel it. The expression ""don't bite more than what you can chew"" perfectly fits in this case.  Amazon has decided to play in the logistics arena but they will continue loosing sales if they stick to their plans.  Amazon, you're a merchandiser, stick to selling; stop pretending to be a delivery crew because you don't have the resources, expertise and professionalism of a well known real mail team.PD: I am not up in the Rocky Mountains. I am just 14 miles away from their Mega Warehouse and Fulfilment Center in Miami and yet they could not deliver my stuff in 14 days. It's unbelievable.  "
William Field Porter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I haven't bought from Amazon for a long time, so the debit card they have on file has expired long ago and been thrown out. Without the expiry date on the old debit card  I cannot log in. The is no option  to update the card. After 2 expensive calls to the US - diverted to the Philippines and India - they could not find my account even though Amazon sent me an email with a one-time-password. The first call was disconnected as I was being put through to another department. Amazon - if you can't get your basic systems right, how can we trust you with our orders?"
Bhav Dalay,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We have always been happy with Amazon and with their refund policy. But on this occasion very disappointed with them. We ordered a motherboard for my son on Prime for next day delivery but it didn‚Äôt arrive even though it showed it was out for delivery. We then waited for delivery the following day and again it didn‚Äôt arrive. With a frustrated teenager who was eager to build his pc, I called customer services who said it has got lost in the depot and promise to send another one.A parcel finally arrived, the driver called me to check if I was home. After giving the driver the code he left the parcel. The parcel box was smaller than what was expected and very light. When we opened it inside it was socks and a wind up toy. We phoned Amazon customer services immediately sent them photos as requested and returned that parcel on 13th December. Since then we have been waiting for Amazon to refund as over ¬£400 but they keep saying the item has not been received and we have to wait for returns department to process the return and wait until end of February. Tracking shows the item has been received by them. Very disappointed as they delivered the wrong item. I have ring doorbell footage of the parcel that was delivered and definitely a motherboard wouldn‚Äôt have fitted in that box. But customers service aren‚Äôt interested and just keep telling me to wait until end of February for a refund. "
Stuart,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon r disgusting appalling discriminating against me and bias against me. As well as trustpilot as they believe amazon multi million pound company. Rather than me and my family as the customer of amazon. And i have proof yet u big companies don't listen to us small people. But u will not get rid of me and i will nrver stop saying and telling the truth. Because in my country we still have freedom of speech and amazon trustpilot will never stop me in telling the truth. And i will never stop never. Because I'm nit being bullied by amazon or trustpilot or anyone. If u want a battle u got 1 and i will never stop. 
Simon Everitt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Why would you give a delivery driver a one time password when you dont know what's in the box? Item worth a few pounds delivered instead of item worth hundreds. But Amazon insist it was delivered because you gave the delivery man the OTP.They simply haven't thought it through.
Michael Brown,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In early December I bought an archery bow from amazon. I'd had good service up to this point. The bow arrived 10 days late, damaged and unusable . When trying to get a refund from amazon I'm being told that I will have to go to the supplier in China. In British law the contract is with the retailer which is amazon's role in the transaction. So why are amazon allowed to treat their customers in this manner?"

Chris Dee,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There's no such thing as customer service with Amazon. There's always something going wrong, such as getting an entirely different item than the one you purchased. Then there's the problem with reps in chat who demand we follow their protocol with zero concern for how packages lost or refunds. I just had to get a replacement and a refund for two different orders. The first one, I had to return an item while they sent a replacement. Went straight to my UPS store with their shipping label. Two days later, I had to return an item from another order since they sent me something that wasn't anywhere near what I ordered. I was given a refund as soon as UPS stuck a return label on it. My account showed a refund issued as soon as I got home. The first one? Still no refund. Rep in chat told me for some items people get a refund right away and for other items they do not. Yet the rep before him told me refunds are not issued until the item is returned to them. I had a problem with my free trial Prime. Even though I was supposed to able to watch all Prime movies, I could not. I was put on hold for 20 mins and then the rep hung up. Second time, I was told I was being transferred to another dept and they hung up. Same thing, they tell you they have to put you on hold as soon as you are connected to them. Third time, rep told me I couldn't watch Prime movies because my Fire stick ""wasn't registered."" On my account it shows I have a Fire TV. I've had the TV for over a year. I was able to watch my TV for over a year. I wouldn't be calling him if I didn't have a Fire TV. I told him I had the TV for over a year. I am able to watch free non prime movies and everything else. I never had a Prime and was given an opportunity to get it free for 30 days. I ended up having to figure this out on my own. Obviously, this rep could not simply say he was wrong. And he clearly thought I was an idiot. I ended my free trial. And as far as their fire TV? It's horrible. You'll get constant (and I do mean constant...as in 10 times in a half hour), to remove apps because it no longer has storage for them. I removed everything. Every app I could. The only ones I couldn't remove are the Amazon apps....which you cannot remove because Amazon tells you that you cannot. Still, it continued to tell me I had no storage. Nothing about Amazon is worth purchasing anything from them. I feel bad for their drivers. I've never had issues with them and they seem to work very hard. I'm sure they are treated the same as us customers. I am no longer one."
Paul Dunwell,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Let's start 2025 by giving Amazon the kicking it deserves. Because you can write to would-be starfleet-commander Jeff Bezos using his first name only but he just leaves it to halfwit earthbound minions to deal with whatever he receives.This time I have yet again complained that the courier delivered a package (ordered by my daughter through Amazon Canada for delivery to me in the UK) by not ringing the bell and then leaving it sticking out of the bin so it could easily have been stolen by the drug-deal next-door or one of his clients. No it's not rocket-science. Most people with an IQ of 30 (when crows may have IQs of up to 85) know that to deliver a package we begin by ringing the doorbell. And if nobody answers they know that the parcel must be left in a safe place. Or it simply has not been safely delivered.Unfortunately I have had this again and again. This time around I managed to get Amazon UK (which has not taken ownership of TrustPilot's page for Amazon UK) on the phone (though the system is designed to obstruct a complaint by a recipient by asking which of your orders is it about). And there was something of a conversation. I sent photos too. After which they offered me nothing for my time. They just wanted me to pat them on the back. As if. Then I wrote to Jeff Bezos. So somebody else called me and took a load more of my time today. Again when they seem unwilling to pay for it. Worse, though, because Jeff Bezos seems to have hand-picked people far too dim to learn anything from whatever a disgruntled customer tells them. It just goes in one ear and out of the other because it is unlikely to hit a neurone en route. Jeff PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE forget this space nonsense. I seriously would not get on a bus you were running.  You can have the most complex system in the world but if you don't fix the gremlins with it, if you just leave morons running it, then the whole thing is a liability. Paul Dunwell, Cambridgeshire"

Brendan Downing,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"This ones partially on me for not checking the order upon arrival.  But what happened to the ability to trust a companies integrity?  I ordered a barn door kit from Amazon, selling a product manufactured by 'UMAX'.  Unfortunately I didn't get the door I was constructing on my own finished for another year...one of those when I get to it home projects.  Finally got around to completion, went to the boxes with the hardware from Amazon and, low and behold, there were several items missing from the kit, items which were shown in the inventory pictures on the Amazon product page.  Somewhat important items like....wheels and rail mount spacers and bolts.  I ended up having to purchase seperately as it was too long since the order date.  But please, come on, the company should make good on their promise after collecting your money.  Note to self:  check the order when received or buy from a brick and mortar store...  at least you know where to track down the error."

Funny that the courier said she left the parcels by the door - when she actually handed them direct to my daughter who was on duty for me.

Howard Walmsley,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is my main source or retail. They have done some amazing things; however, they over promise a lot.  Recently, and several other times before, I get in a rush for things. Maybe a show or a party, in this case, a house warming party.  We could have gotten all the the items from local retailer (which we did) but we first tried filtering by receive tomorrow in Amazon. We only chose our items form items that would be delivered the next day as we must absolutely have them the next day.  Guess what?  They didn‚Äôt arrive.  At last minute, they say now arriving the following day. Well we only ordered those products because they were promised to come the next day. We even adjusted our quantify so it would arrive in time. It didn‚Äôt. So, I have to say, relying on Amazon for something  you absolutely need now or tomorrow, not a good system. Amazon is still good for those items you don‚Äôt need rushed.  But if you need it tomorrow, shop local.  "

I've been waiting on something very special it arrived in the state next to me Friday at 4pm. They said it would be delivered today, so I took the day off to wait for the package. Checked at 1 (because it was late) and now it won't be here till January 9th because of weather? Wtf? 11 days, why 11 days, they don't know, they don't care. So I have to drive an hour today to a special book store to get it because I need it TODAY!!!. This is like the 11th time this has happened this year, I've had it. Their customer service sucks, NOTHING is delivered in 2 days Prime or not, idk what happened to this company but I'll never use it again.

I requested a return but instead of the normal free return on Amazon purchases I was informed by the third party vendor (Amarjit Gulati) that we would have to fund the refund myself which cost us ¬£9.35.

They don‚Äôt even ring the doorbell of the wrong flat ( if they did the neighbour would tell them to deliver to the back of the building ). They have left multiple parcels all addressed to different flat numbers on the doorstep of the front flat. This means the parcels are left outside there for any passers by to pick up. They are also left to get wet in the rain. I have had to go and look for parcels to try to find them. On one occasion an iPhone was delivered to an address down the road.

Well, apparently delivering an item in a timely manner is an impossible task for them. They handed my package over to a cheap, no-name courier who never delivered it. Weeks went by, and all I had was silence, frustration, and the looming realization that I had just paid Amazon to give me a headache.After over a month of waiting and chasing them for answers, I finally threw in the towel and asked for a refund. But wait, the drama wasn‚Äôt over! It took over a week for Amazon to return my money. That‚Äôs right, not only did they fail to deliver, but they also held my money hostage like some kind of twisted retail ransom.This wasn‚Äôt just poor service; it was an outright betrayal of the trust I had in Amazon.

Dee Neil,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Been using Amazon for many years.  While product reviews are questionable (watch out for low review counts with high star averaged), I'm continually impressed with Amazon's performance (shopping, order, bill, ship, email updates), as well as their shipping partners' performance (UPS, FedEx).  Pay attention to whether the product ships from an Amazon fulfillment center, or instead, remote 2nd party vendors -- delivery experience will be drastically different between these two, even for long time Prime members).  But in all fairness, 2nd party vendors are often just using Amazon for product visibility for selling purposes.  Amazon is not directly responsible for 2nd party vendor performance.  On the other hand, Amazon should be using poor customer reviews for purposes of removing them from the site because it makes Amazon look bad.......just sayin.  If you want the Amazon name to remain untarnished, get ride of bad sellers  or bad products."

It then went to a different state at one city, then another city in that same state.  Then, it came back to the state where it originated from, but a different city which is the same distance, 112 miles from the delivery point.  It left that site and 2 MINUTES later was back there. NEVER GOT THE ITEM. I CANCELLED THE ORDER on 12/29.The item was delivered after the cancellation. But, it was delivered by US Post Office.On the box it had written on it NIB. That means NEW IN BOX. So someone from AMAZON was CAUGHT TRYING TO SELL my ordered item. And then gave it over to the Post Office for delivery.Amazon NEED TO FIRE the employees that were involved.Since it was CANCELLED it was given to the Post Office to return to Amazon. Watch what you buy from Amazon, and especially on the delivery status.Today, 1/9/25, I checked to see the REFUND STATUS.  NO REFUND YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is UNACCEPTABLE AS I ACTUALLY SPOKE TO AN AMAZON WORKER WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE AND THE ORDER WOULD BE CANCELLED. I Spoke with Mihaheao on 12/29/24 at 3:41 pm Pacific Time to cancel.  Then, an online chat with Thariq on 12/31/24.

For the first few weeks, I was told that the return had not been received. Finally, it was accepted that the item was received and the story then became that the repair centre was waiting for the part required to fix it. Then, after another two weeks, I was told that it had been repaired and returned. I waited in for two days to receive it, before chasing again. Next I was told that it could not be repaired and I would get a replacement or a refund?? The same product is actually still for sale and is ¬£30 cheaper, so surely just send another one?? Wait a week and the system has been updated to show it has been repaired. Another two conversations and the story has changed again. Now, the item cannot be repaired and I will get a refund in the middle of January. Then I called again to complain and was told that it had been escalated (for the third time) and I would be refunded today. Nothing happened. I have just come off the phone without a sensible answer and been informed that the refund could take 60 days?? I still have no cooker which is a handy thing to have over Christmas and no refund. TBH this whole experience has put me off Amazon. It seems like they have no idea how to deliver customer service if an item should fail. I now understand how the owner has amassed such huge personal wealth. If anyone is making a fortune there are two possible reasons. One, they are ripping off their employees or two, they are providing poor service. Or maybe both at the same time!! Either way, I am one very unhappy customer and am frankly stunned. After it was supposedly escalated three times there is silence."
Luc Doiron,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"the problem isn't with Amazon as much as it is with the Contractors they use for delivery, I ordered a tv based on a 2 day Guarantee, after waiting at home for 12 hours they update the status of delivery saying it was delayed due to weather conditions in delivery area, there were no storms of any kind in that 2 day period finally I called Amazon customer service to get to the bottom of this, they said the parcel was still out for delivery but tracking status hadn't been update since the day after it left the depot, lies and more lies! intellicom is a horrible company"

The next day they said it will be delivered on DEC 16, 2024. We cancel it on DEC 15, 2024 because no one could be at home to receive merchandise and were concerned it would be stolen.

Jeff Dowd,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered an item to give as a gift.  Tracking indicated item arrived at my local post office on the expected date then indicates it was transferred to another carrier.  At which point all tracking updates stop.  No indication who the other carrier is.  Amazon indicates package is running late and to return the next day for a refund.  The next day it's the same message, return the next day.  This goes on for a week.  Trying to request a refund through the app all you get is AI garage.  When you finally get through to a human they hand you off to someone else after 10 minutes wasted in chat.  Another wasted 10 minutes in chat with person #2 results in being told they can't process a refund and that you'll get a voice call.  Voice call person has none of the information you reviewed with the first two people.  At this point the garbage AI that just leads you around in a circle is more helpful.  Voice person informs you they can't issue a refund until the item is returned to the seller.  How the hell is an item that has been lost or stolen in shipping going to arrive back at the seller?  Next time I'll save my time and just dispute the charges with my cc company.  Amazon CS is garbage."

Amazon removed the feedback as they didn't like my ""One Star"" review and stated ""There was too much focus on the packaging"" The brush head came stuffed into the hepa filters and so the nylon brush was pushed out of shape allover and so would have been useless on the carpet and in the process strained the filters material.The end of the brush was worn and chipped.All that was needed was to pack the three items separately in the same box.problem solved."

Used to be a reliable and consistent logistics company, now deliveries are almost always late, the products on offer are worse than a few years ago. honestly; prime is meaningless if you're paying for prompt delivery. absolutely sick of this company, it's clearly in decline and is failing to recognise and address the issues.

nicole higdon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered Christmas presents for my kids on Amazon. It was the first time ever. I usually use ebay. I figured shopping would be faster if I used Amazon. They solicit me constantly all year to sign up for prime and get all these discounts. I figured Christmas this year would be the test to see if Amazon is really that great. Well, this time they didn't solicit me for a prime membership or offer any discounts. They didn't even give faster shipping options. Now, for the first time ever, more than half of all the Christmas presents did not arrive yet. They haven't even been shipped. There are items that aren't coming for another month still. It's ridiculous! Amazon is a sham. It's overpriced garbage, and they deliberately don't ship your items right away if you don't pay for their stupid prime membership. I'll never order anything from Amazon again. I'll go back to ebay where I can get the same stuff cheaper and much faster! Amazon sucks, and Jeff Bezos is a criminal for selling people's data and using it to get filthy rich while undercutting other small businesses. Keep licking the brown eye of corporations, America! "

James H Finkelstein,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In July 2024, I purchased a ""Canon Genuine Toner Cartridge 054H Black"" from Amazon.  In less than six months, it started producing black vertical lines.  Since this was sold as a ""genuine"" Canon product, I called Canon support.  They were extremely helpful and determined that the toner cartridge was a counterfeit.  I filed a report with their anti-counterfeit department.When I called Amazon to report this is when the problems began.  The first time I called, the representative said that since the purchase was more than 120 days ago, there was nothing they could do.  Eventually, they offered a partial refund, which I told them was unacceptable.  After nearly 30 minutes on hold, I figured out the representative had disconnected the call.I called back.  I explained the situation and after another 20 minutes, this representative assured me that I would received a full credit to my Amazon account.  The next morning, I received a notice from Amazon that a partial credit had been issued to my AMEX card.  So, I called back again, explaining that Amazon had sold me a counterfeit product which had been verified as such by the manufacturer.  Again, I got the 120 story and was told there was a ""restocking fee.""  I tried to explain that you cannot restock a counterfeit product and demanded a full refund.  It took me another 30 minutes, but I finally prevailed.Beyond the frustration of dealing with Amazon customer dis-service, at no time did any representative express concern about selling a counterfeit product or indicate that this would be reported within the company.  So the seller will likely continue to sell these toner cartridges.As it turns out, Amazon sells a lot of counterfeit toner cartridges.  This one came from the seller, Anurice Supplies.  Do not buy anything from this seller.  If you have, and it was marked as a Canon product, check the QR code square.  If it has boxes in three of the corners, according to Canon it is counterfeit.  Also look at the Canon name on the cartridge.  If it is painted on, it is a counterfeit.  There are other signs as well.This seller must be banned from Amazon immediately.  Their counterfeit product could have ruined my printer.   And, Amazon need to take immediate responsibility for these situations and make the customer whole without question.Shame on Amazon.  I'll never buy a toner cartridge from them again. "
AmC,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Prime has gone completely down the pan. For years, I always received my orders on time, but in the last 6 months, my orders have been consistently late by one day or several days. Or I'm notified that my order has been dispatched and is on its way, only for it to be cancelled, with no immediate update provided on when I'll actually be receiving my order. In the latest debacle, I ordered a product via Prime on a Friday and was told I would receive it by 1pm the following day. The order never arrived, and Amazon notified me if would come the following day instead. The order never arrived, then the following day (Monday), I was notified that the parcel has been dispatched and would reach me before 5pm. Again, the order never arrived and I got no update from Amazon re when it would be arriving. Then the following morning (three days after my parcel should have arrived) I get an email telling me my package has been ""lost"" by Amazon. I then clicked on the option to cancel/replace my order, but the Amazon website kept leading me to a dead page.I then connected with one of Amazon's customer service reps who assured me they would send a replacement out ASAP, to my old address (where my old housemate still lives) as I was going away the following day. A replacement was promptly dispatched the following morning, but, lo and behold...the wrong item had been sent! The item that was delivered wasn't remotely related to what I did order. I have no idea how they managed to mess that up so monumentally. In my delivery confirmation email, Amazon have also wrongly confirmed that they had delivered the product I actually requested. Once again, I have to go through the hassle of chasing up an Amazon customer service rep and requesting yet another replacement. This is exactly a week after my item should have arrived. Third time lucky? At this rate, I highly doubt it.I'm close to cancelling my Prime subscription as it's just not worth the hassle anymore. I don't understand how/why the company's delivery service has completely nosedived in the past 6 months."

edward kanzler,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,At Amazons invitation I applied for their Visa Card. They use Chase Bank to process their credit applications.It is worth noting that I am a long time prime member of Amazon and up until now a big Amazon supporter. I also have a excellent credit rating (797). Never missed a payment with anyone at any time. Having said that the poor treatment I was subjected to at the hands of Chase took me by surprise and ended in absolute frustration. Consequently I chose to end further discussions with them. This not only left me feeling negatively about Chase but for Amazon as well because Amazon selected Chase as their third party representative who then subjected me  (an Amazon customer) to such poor treatment.  This is ironic given that Amazon themselves is the gold standard in my opinion for good service.If you are considering applying for a Amazon Visa card or thinking about doing business with the Chase Bank  I would advise against it.
Courtney Cole,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon, what a CON of a company. The definition of GREED. They're literally stealing money from people, stealing return packages to resell on their ""lost packages"" system. Any member who has returned an item, amazon can just say that they ""didn't receive it"" without showing any evidence that it hadn't been received, as they don't provide tracking info on the returns, so they can claim they didn't receive and then recharge you for the item! Customer service are no help, they don't answer properly and they say a better team will provide answers and ""escalate the issue"" but this so called ""escalation team"" also have no clue. They're not there to help you. Amazon is a billion pound company. They amount of sales they make a day is unreal, so for them to steal money off of people, especially over Christmas is so outrageous.

Mike oxmaul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I don't like that they pick and choose which reviews I write about products they decide what they want to post or keep hidden. Allowing the people selling on Amazon to pay amazon for top reviews. I like the ease of shopping on amazon but not knowing if I can trust the reviews on their pages is bothersome.  On top of that if you wanna cancel an order ( because it's arriving late) they'll still send it and leave it up to you to return it to a shipper playing the odds that you're not gonna ship it back which is absolutely absurd. 
Roberto Mesir,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I cannot believe that this company still exists. The way they (do not) communicate with customers, how they behave, and how they treat their customers is absolutely unacceptable. Anytime I order something, it takes 2-3 months for them to deliver. There is no way of contacting them to ask what happened to my order, and all the information on their pages is obviously manipulated to take as much money from customers as possible.Other websites, like AliExpress, are ten times better and cheaper than Amazon.

That is the proof of a good company. Sadly amazon fails badly in this. They asked me to photograph the item and send it.. This I did, same day. They asked me to return it. This I did same day. Then they asked for proof of postage. So I photographed the postal receipt and sent that on the 12  Dec. Then nothing. So I phoned them. They informed me I would have to wait until they received the item before they would issue a refund, this could take 14 days. I had bought this phone as a Xmas present for my wife and I hadn't got another 1150 to gamble with, so poor wife. Bear in mind this is their mess and their customer service attitude was we are very sorry but just your bad luck. So I waited the 14 days and rang back. It seems now you have to wait up to 30 days for it to be processed. When I pointed out to the service agent that it was their mess he just kept speaking over me with a mantra saying is there anything else I can help you with. Kept repeating this over and over and then hung upUnbelievable customer service. I have now had to apply to my credit card company to try and stop payment."
Sarah Rayner,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My partner ordered perfume from a seller on Amazon Prime, however despite not having the item in stock when sending out his parcel they chose to send him another perfume he had not ordered rather then just notifying him that the order needed to be cancelled and a refund issued.  On receipt of the wrong item he proceeded to arrange a return, which was not a simple return, He had to pay for the item to be returned as well.  The seller has ignored messages and on returning the item was not in to accept the delivery, they were advised to collect it from the local delivery depot but failed to do so.  The item has now been returned to my partner after a month of returning it.He have contacted Amazon who have been less than helpful, telling him to return it back to the seller again (at his own cost), instead of just arranging to protect his customer rights and arrange for collection of the parcel and a refund of his money.  He now has to send ID which will take 3 days to validate, they are stalling all the way with the refund.  The only decent response should be the seller being struck off from being allowed to sell and my partner should have a full refund, plus posting costs and Amazon should arrange for collection of the item which was never ordered in the first place.My partner has been a Prime member for years but this experience has left him questioning whether Amazon actually care at all about their customers.

Frugal-T,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's customer service has been a nightmare.  I bought a great book on Amazon but the system made a billing addition error.  (or somebody who programed the system made an error.)    Amazon's billing system made an error on my order amount overcharging me.  I called their customer service to inform them of this and request that the over billed amount be refunded.   They agreed and said the refund would be placed in my gift card balance in my account within 3 to 5 days.   First contact was initiated on 11/29/2024.  Since then (today is 12/26/2024) nothing has shown up.  I have currently called in about 9 times to check on the status.  Each time I'm told wait another 24 to 48 hours or even worse, hung up on.  As I said, this has gone on about 9 times now, and counting.  I even have an email from them with a ""Ticket number"" indicated the action to be taken but nothing is happening.  I called up their corporate  office to try and get help only to be rebuffed and told I needed to send them a written letter to a PO box for help.  I requested that they give me an email address to avoid all the USPS mailing hassle but they refused to do so, indicating that was not ""their policy"".  BS that policy!  Imagine, Amazon one of the Corporate giant TECH companies not having an email address for customer problem input.  It reeks of a blatant effort to road block customer problems from being known or heard.  I then asked for a contact number in the USA where I could talk to management.  I was told that was not an option then quickly hung up on by the corporate customer representative at the Seattle WA, 206-266-1000 number.    Amazon is a great retailer and supplier but heaven forbid should something go wrong and you have to deal with their customer service people who can only follow a script that is put in front of them.

Amy Murray,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Beware of amazon customer services, I have been  lied  to,  ignored and  passed from pillar to post  and  been told 'i hope you can understand' for a global company the fact you operate as different  markets with different  rules is disgusting. when asked for details to escalate a complaint i was brushed off. This  is terrible for the US who are meant  to have some  of the best customer service,"
Victoria,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I don't even want to leave a star at all but I have no choice. They tell you your order will be delivered in a day and it will all be shipped together. They are such liars. They have this and so much more in common with walmart. Money hungry and care nothing about the customer. We are what has made you rich. Without customers....you would have NOTHING!!!!! I am through  with Amazon. I have placed several items since December 22 and they are coming every which of the way. Not like they said they would. You expect to get your items as planned. It never happens on Amazon!!!!!!
Darren Howard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I like the service Amazon provide. The choice etc BUT come on. Greed is very off-putting. Charging Prime members to rent so many Christmas movies is disgusting. You should be ashamed of this. It annoyed me so much I have cancelled my prime membership and will not renew it. I know many others who have also done the same. You need to learn a lesson from this. People DO NOT LIKE BEING RIPPED OFF!!!!

Hamlet,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a brand-new Google Pixel 8 from Amazon, expecting the reliable service they promise. Instead, I received a used Google Pixel 8a, which is a completely different and cheaper product. To make matters worse, I had already paid for international shipping and customs duties to get the phone delivered to Armenia, only to end up with the wrong item.When I contacted Amazon support, I was told to return the phone for a refund. However, the shipping company in my country does not allow phones to be shipped back, leaving me stuck. I requested a partial refund because the item I received is worth significantly less than what I paid, but Amazon flat-out rejected this reasonable request.Now, I‚Äôm left with a phone I didn‚Äôt order, a financial loss, and no practical solution. This experience has shattered my trust in Amazon, as it seems international customers are left to deal with issues caused by Amazon or their sellers, with no real support or understanding.This situation feels like I‚Äôve been cheated twice: first by receiving the wrong product and then by Amazon refusing to resolve it fairly. International customers, beware ‚Äì you might not have the safety net you expect from a company of this size."

The first order arrived wo weeks early. The other 9 at various times have reached the Buena Park depot and have disappeared. The only recourse seems to be the customer chat which takes so long for them to find anything that the chat disconnects, and you have start all over or requesting they call you, which if they do manage to bother they ask repeatedly for the same order numbers and say call back in a few days if it hasn't come. Getting a refund requires you to be a rocket scientist. Fill out an incident report and make sure to use the American date format or they will just disregard it, then wait a week and call back where they try to make you do it all again. almost 3 months later I am still trying to get half of my money refunded. No accountability, no care, no way I am using them again."

Mark Pruner,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Eight times Amazon has delivered my package and eight times they have taken it away, because their system can't text me the code that I have to show the driver in order for him to leave the package. I've spoken to 14 agents, had the issue ""escalated"" three times and there is a good chance that they are keeping my money from the $200 gift certificate that I used. It all started, when my team won a hackathon and we each got a $200 gift certificate. I set up an account using my cell phone number and ordered a Braun shaver. Unbeknownst to me Braun requires that you give a code to the driver at delivery or they won't leave the package. On Monday, I wasn't home and never got a code on my phone. On Tuesday, a new driver came back and took the package back with her, because I didn't have the code, which he requests from the Amazon system, when he arrives at my house. I tried the chat help and after 20 minutes, the agent said he couldn't help me, texted me a link and said enter your number and they will call you back. I did, no one ever called. (They can text me links and confirmations requests, just not the code I need.) A third driver showed up on Wednesday asking for the code and with no code took the package back.Thursday, I spoke to an agent who couldn't find my account using my cell phone number. My shaver once again made a round trip. Friday, they took off.On Saturday, when I tried to use my cellphone number to login, the website said no account for that number. I spoke with two agents, one for 50 minutes and then another account teams agent who finally found the order. A fourth driver tried to deliver the package again. He said if he left the package without the code he would be fired. Of the 14 agents I have spoke to three agents, once they understood how unusual the situation was, our call got mysteriously disconnected. They don't seem to like long calls.I had two more delivery attempts and three more phone calls. Two days ago, I got escalated to the account team for the third time. The agent said he couldn't refund money to a gift certificate, nor could he credit my credit card. I asked to speak to a manager. after 1.5 hours on the phone. The manager said he would cancel the order and try to refund the money to the gift certificate so I could use it again. (While I was on the phone, the driver who had done the two previous deliveries tried to deliver the package for the 7th time.)On Monday, this poor driver tried for a 4th time and for 8 deliveries in total. The order has now been cancelled. I have not received the shaver and the gift certificate shows it's been redeemed. I'm fed up with Amazon and it looks like they are going to be keeping my $214 and not deliver the shaver. Amazon has created a sales system that makes Pentagon acquisitions seem simple. No one has the authority to make an exception when their system doesn't work. I wish I could have gotten a gift certificate to any other business. "

Again, it's impossible as all my years of activity have been deleted. Why the hell do they make everything so difficult to keep you trapped. I now have an item that is broken and too difficult to understand how to assembly it. I am really annoyed with Amazon.Update:  Have tried assembling the item again (telescopic shower rail with multiple uses) but find it impossible so can't say I haven't tried, but I can't contact anyone at Amazon via Live Chat, so virtually impossible to get a return/refund on this useless item. I'm bitterly disappointed with Amazon as have used them a lot over the years so unless they make contact to put this right I won't be using them again. They are so quick to get your business then make it virtually impossible to make contact with them. Very Very angry."

Unfortunately, I would not have expected such an approach from a platform like Amazon.My demands:A clear and detailed explanation of why my account was closed.The balance of 10,000 USD in my account should be returned to me immediately.If the account closure decision is due to a mistake or a correctable situation, my store will be reactivated.Amazon's reliability and fair structure continues to exist with sellers and customers acting together.

PurpleBand,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I regularly purchase office supplies from Amazon as a result of the convenience from Prime and often suspiciously cheap price. On this occasion, the price has paid off. I purchased a Q-Connect Whiteboard Cleaner for just under ¬£2 from Amazon and upon first usage, the odour was extremely strong and caused a burning effect in my eyes. Just under 12 hours later, I was sat in A&E waiting to be seen when I was informed the product itself was actually a very strong alcohol which should have a warning on the packaging (which it was missing) thus the item had caused my physical harm and dried out my eyes. Upon recovering, I immediately reported this to Amazon Customer Service who from step one didn't take the claim seriously and suggested that it wasn't their issue even though the item was sold by Amazon. Following multiple contact requests and refusal to send my complete medical records, I was issued an apology and ¬£25 compensation with no option but to close the case. I believe this is a serious safety issue and will be taking this up with Trading Standards. I'd never purchase consumables (especially chemicals) from Amazon again."

Jennifer Moore-Rawding,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a prime member since 2021 when I started my own business.  Right away I experienced issues with receiving packages late or not at all. I literally had to write in delivery notes to double check house number. Here we are almost 4 years later and the problems with amazon has not improved. In fact, they're worse. Besides the fact that there's a 50/50 shot of actually getting your order but now they make you wait 3 or 4 days after you're supposed to receive your order to even start a conversation on replacement/ refund. Not only that, they are fully aware that a large portion of their sellers are giving misleading information about products or flat out false advertising. Unfortunately,  Amazon has made it impossible to give truthful reviews on their site regardless whether it's about the product,  seller, or Amazon themselves.  So there's absolutely no way to feel confident about your purchase. I've contacted customer service through chats or by phone and rarely are my issues resolved.  In fact, it typically causes additional confusion and problems.  I've wanted to write  review on Amazon the company for a long time now but due to how big the cooperation is, they block you at every turn. I use Walmart any day over Amazon even though their prices are slightly higher. Big cooperations like Amazon, care little for their consumers and it seems like they aren't even attempting to sound empathetic or resolve the issue. If I could give Amazon zero stars I most definitely would."

Barath Kalaisezhian,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I'm deeply devastated by the scam I encountered on Amazon. Yesterday, I ordered an MSI gaming laptop (MSI Sword 17HX 17 Inch 16:10 QHD+ 24) for ¬£499.00, with order #203-5153837-0278764, from a seller called ""ANGELINA MANUKYAN."" Shortly after placing the order, I received a message from the seller stating that my order couldn‚Äôt be processed and urging me to contact them urgently via a QR code, which led to an Amazon support chat box. When I asked the seller why my order couldn‚Äôt be processed, they claimed it was due to logistical issues and offered to fulfill the same laptop from a different warehouse. They asked if I was willing to proceed, and I agreed. To confirm the legitimacy of this, I called Amazon customer service. They assured me that this was normal for third-party sellers and encouraged me to continue. Following their advice, the seller then asked me to make the payment via a Payoneer link, offering a 10% discount. I checked with Amazon customer service again, speaking to an agent named Ahmed, who confirmed that it was a legitimate request and told me to proceed. I made the payment, but I still haven‚Äôt received any order confirmation or ID. As time passed without any response, I started to suspect something was wrong. I called Amazon support once again, and an agent told me to wait until Monday for the seller to respond. That‚Äôs when I realized it was a scam, especially after I mentioned that the seller didn‚Äôt even appear on Amazon‚Äôs website. The agent assured me he could still find the seller, which added to the confusion. Now, I‚Äôm heartbroken and devastated to lose such a significant amount of money. This experience has shattered my trust in Amazon, and I never expected something like this could happen on such a reputable platform. I kindly ask for your help in recovering my money. Losing my savings this way is extremely painful."

This time there's was no mail notification at all despite me checking it. On amazon it said that package would be there at 10pm today. Luckily, I didn't rely on their erroneous prediction and checked their website again this afternoon. Yep, package was already there and arrived 2 hours earlier.

Bob S,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is targeting us ever since we made a valid complaint.   We‚Äôre now on the ‚ÄúBAD‚Äù list.  Everytime we call Amazon with a legit complaint, we‚Äôre no longer offered our money back, even with a photo of the damage.  We‚Äôre being told to reassemble scratched furniture and mail back leaking bottles of cleaning spray.  When we complained in early December 12/6, (after five calls), re absent refund for returned merchandise from 3 wks prior, we spoke with an escalation supervisor, Hannah.  The next day, on 12/7, we received a letter from the accounts specialty team saying we‚Äôve been returning broken merchandise?    Our account is being looked into?   We are extremely meticulous in all of our returns.   We‚Äôre 10 year prime members.  We‚Äôre seniors.   This was a falsehood created by this supervisor so that now when we call, we are immediately bumped up to an escalation supervisor and told we need to send photos of leaky bottles, scratched furniture, return things etc.   In other words, we‚Äôre treated like we have something to prove.   I complained to BBB.  we were offered a partial refund.  I declined that because I want the damaging letter removed from my file, as well.  I received an email that no such letter exists.  When I replied with a copy of the letter by Hannah which remarks about the letter and that it does, in fact, exist, I received NO further reply or acknowledgement.   However, the prior email from Hannah directs me to reply to an account specialist re my being a ‚Äúbad‚Äù customer & she told me on the phone they‚Äôre investigating fraud?  Outrageous.   We‚Äôre both seniors who are law abiding citizens and have never returned anything we damaged.   Now,  I need to disprove a letter that was created to intimidate me (and let me know I ought never complain), because there‚Äôs going to be consequences.  Unfortunately, we‚Äôre all part of this Amazon cult.  We need items expeditiously and we buy from this business repeatedly.  We shop at Whole Foods, so we also are buying from Amazon.   We may be pleased with some merchandise - the  majority of which we keep, but then if we received anything damaged, we‚Äôre treated like we made something up.  Shameful, disgusting and unethical treatment.   Btw, BBB dropped the complaint even after I declined the $50.  I wanted the letter dropped too.  Now, I no longer have the $50 credit offer and the letter still exists given my most recent Amazon complaint today.  My wife and I are busy taking photos of spray bottles with cleaner that left black marks all over the box.  We are now having to prove Amazon‚Äôs own negligence.  Beware of this seller.  Never thought this would happen but apparently you can be ‚Äúblacklisted‚Äù if you complain to the wrong supervisor."

wilson mendes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon customer service is not great, a miss delivered and lost item, make lose more than one hour with customer service, 3 different people, no answers from them, just an apology and a fight for a compensation (¬£5). From a way more valuable item."
Paul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is an absolute fraudulent business. More then once have they made mistakes and told me there‚Äôs nothing they can do. This last issue put me over the edge. Order Christmas Gifts with Faster Shipping, everyone of them was late. They charged my Checking Account when I clearly selected my Discover Card. The Invoice and Order Details even show Discover as my Payment. Realizing I was short in my Bank Account I noticed Amazon charged my Bank Account which set me into being Overdrawn with a bunch of Overdraft fees. So now Christmas with an empty bank account and fees due to Amazon being such fraudulent pricks. Do not believe product reviews, everything I ordered had great reviews and 75% of the products are absolute crap. I won‚Äôt t be shopping at Amazon any more but I will see you in Court."
Kara,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a book on Amazon. When I received the book, the packing was intact and in good shape, but the book was ripped and the spine was crushed. It clearly happened in their warehouse before they ever sent it. I wanted to exchange it for an identical item that wasn‚Äôt damaged but they want to charge me to send it back. What kind of garbage is that?  The ‚Äúfree‚Äù option to send it back is over 11 miles away, but there are options in my town, but they want almost the full price of the book for me to use them. I feel like if they are the ones that damaged it I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay anything to exchange it. Since they are making me drive so far away I‚Äôm just going to send it back and buy it elsewhere. No wonder Temu sales are up and Amazon are down. Temu has excellent customer service. Their rating on here tells you everything you need to know."
Kristine Gionson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has been good until someone ordered a baby stroller and car seat using my account and credit card.  This scammed used my name and their address in Pocasset, MA.  I tried to look for a phone number but there was none.  So I reported this to Ama zon as a scam on their fraud reporting online.  I called the bank and they did a charge back.  Then I was texted that the items were delivered. I changed my password and started the two step verification. Then Amazon text me saying they don't have enough information and to explain it to their email.  So I did that and they froze my account!  There was a note from them that appeared when I signed in saying that it will not be available until I pay for the items: $676!  They also said that they require me to fill out a form and they will consider making it available.  I searched the internet for a customer service number and I found it.  I called and one customer service agent said she sent a link for the form. I clicked on the link but it required me to sign into my account which takes me nowhere because my account is frozen!"
Julia King,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Don‚Äôt use Amazon for high value / high desirability goods, such as IPads etc. They use a one time password on delivery. But when we received the delivery, we found our iPad substituted with a lower value item, a book! Amazon asked us to fill in a police report as ‚Äòvictims‚Äô not acknowledging their processes may be at fault, ie any one time passcode item can be substituted with a lower value item of similar size and weight at the Amazon warehouse. We are still battling with Amazon for refund, and have passed the issue to our credit card company. Be very, very wary of Amazon"

Found out through tmobile (by giving my EIN#) my phone still has a balance on it from the original owner. Not free and clear. 12/3/24-Contact Amazon. They tell me I have to message the seller first to see if they will honor a return. They will initiate an A-Z warranty claim. 12/4/24-Seller will not honor return due to the time that has elapsed (over 90 days). 12/5/24-Call Amazon and explain the fraudulent issue. Ask what are next steps for A-Z warranty claim. I am told no claim was filed. The only thing they can do is file a claim and wait 24 hours for the seller to respond. I explain we already did this on Monday. I am told this is all they can do. 12/6/24-Posted Device Giant review. It was blocked. 12/7/24-I have waited more than 24 hours. The 3rd party seller, Device Giant, initially said they would honor the return and then sent a second email saying they wouldn‚Äôt. Contact Amazon again for next steps in warranty claim. I am told no warranty claim was filed, but this rep would file a claim. I was told they would honor the return and block this third party seller. I asked for something in writing since this had all been said to me already. They rep sent an email (see below) and said I would receive another email within 7 days explaining the next steps of the return process. I was told not to worry and they would make this right.  12/15/24-Call Amazon. There is no email for return. The rep says no warranty was filed and that the previous rep likely told me what I wanted to hear to get me off of the phone. She of course says she can fie a warranty for me and reach out to the seller. I explain again we‚Äôve done this multiple times already I ask to speak to a manager. She puts me on hold and comes back 20 minutes later stating the only thing she can do is file a warranty claim and reach out to the seller. I explain that I will not do this process again. She says she understands I am upset. She divulges that this is not a new complaint for this seller and that many others have complained about them selling devices that are not free and clear. I ask her why this seller hasn‚Äôt been banned to protect their customers from this fraud. I am told she doensn‚Äôt have an answer. I demand to speak to her manager. She puts me on ‚Äúhold‚Äù but really disconnects the line. I call back and get hung up on again when 12/15/24-Posted Device Giant review. It was blocked. "

Today I have now received a further update stating that the order will now arrive by the 26th December. I attempted to cancel the order but am told by amazon that I can only cancel if I don't receive it by the 26th December. Amazon tries to blame the seller they seem to forget you are ordering from them therefore they have a legal obligation to get things right. I personally think that everyone should stop using Amazon and then see where they go"

When I brought it inside and removed the packaging I noticed that 1 of the door hinge cover on the mini freezer was damaged. I contacted amazon's customer service on 9th December and asked  if I can get a partial refund so that I can replace the damaged hinge cover, however I was refused a partial refund and she informed me that I would need to return the entire freezer for a full refund.

Gita,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon Prime subscriber for years, but the number of adverts on Prime Video has become unbearable. Watching a 44-minute episode was interrupted with 4 ad breaks and a total of 9 adverts.Prime Video used to offer an ad-free experience as part of the subscription, but now it feels worse than free streaming platforms. Considering the ever-increasing subscription cost, this is unacceptable.I subscribed to Prime for convenience and quality, but the constant adverts make the service feel less valuable than before. Unless this changes, I‚Äôll be reconsidering my membership. We will not be paying more. If anything I‚Äôll make less online orders due to this.I order a lot from Amazon as well, but I suspect this will change as we will be cancelling our subscription due to the adverts on Prime Video.

Charlie-bad Behaviour-power,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've not used amazon for some years but did a few days ago. This failed attempt to gat a basic item reminds me why I stopped using them.

Gunashekar kalluri,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently had a frustrating experience with Amazon regarding my order #113-6053458-7642651 for a DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo (DJI RC). I placed the order during the Black Friday sale for $395.75. Shortly after, I identified the seller as potentially fraudulent and reported it to Amazon.Despite my report, Amazon assured me the product would be delivered. I waited for 25 days, following up repeatedly, only to have the order canceled. Amazon refunded my money but refused to compensate me or match the original Black Friday deal price. The product now costs approximately $350 more, and I cannot afford to repurchase it.This experience caused me significant mental stress and wasted time. Amazon‚Äôs failure to promptly address fraudulent sellers and its misleading customer support reflect poorly on their platform.I hope Amazon improves their seller verification and customer service processes. As a loyal customer, this incident has left me deeply disappointed."

Sanna,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolute appaling service from Amazon today. Expecting a delivery so asked for them to leave in the shed/binstore which is next to my front door as I would be out in the afternoon. My lovely friendly efficient EVRI driver has no problem leaving my parcels there if I‚Äôm out. When I returned late afternoon they still hadn‚Äôt delivered. Around 7pm I got an email  ‚Äúdelivered thru your letterbox‚Äù I was actually sitting on my sofa looking at the letterbox. My front door opens straight into my living room. After checking with my neighbours ‚Äúnothing thru any of their letterboxes‚Äù  I decided to try and get in touch with Amazon. They haven‚Äôt even got the order listed on my account üò± i ended up contacting the seller to tell them nothing came thru my letterbox despite what Amazon said. Later in the evening I went out into the garden to search. A neighbour said that‚Äôs where the Amazon driver probably left it. I took a torch and we both searched my garden only to find the package lying on the muddy wet earth. It was lying next to my bin down the far side of my house. Needless to say the package was soaking wet. It left me wondering what sort of house or dwelling does this Amazon driver live in, that he thinks the wet ground next to my bin looks like a letterbox? I was in the house at the time of the delivery but there was no knock at the door, no attempt at making a normal straightforward delivery. I thought Amazon were at the top of their game??? Are they not the delivery experts? After all they are selling this shitty service to other organisations like John Lewis et al. I find that horrifying. Quite honestly the whole experience beggars belief. Come on AMAZON customer service explain this one to me pleaseüòõ"
Eric Riopel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon customer service is the worse and gets worse by the day. The communication between Amazon and the delivery agents doesn‚Äôt exist.

DragonLadyK,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered an item on November 29th on a Black Friday sale as a gift for my son for Christmas. After having to approve a delivery delay (the item was listed to get here in 2 days since I have Prime) 4 times, I used their online chat customer service and was assured it would get here the next day. The following day, I get an email to approve the delay for a 5th time, so I do the phone customer service. Spent a while on the phone and was assured again that it would be here the next day. Today rolls around, item still hasn't shipped and I do phone customer service AGAIN. This time the guy tells me that they are having issues with stock, and that they will send it to me when they have the item. Obviously, at this point I am livid and ask him why they sold the item if they didn't even have it while having it listed to get here in two days... He is quiet, then puts me on hold, then the call hangs up. This is by far the most horrendous experience I've had with customer service! No explanation, strung me along for days, and sold me an item they didn't even have. Now I have to cancel the order and spend $30-50 more for the same type of item to get it. Completely poor business management!"

They have now gone thru my account, and say I have claimed not reciving items, when items arrived brokenüò± also against their policyüò±, when they put porcelain inside a cardboard box, with two strips of brown paper. Nothing to absorb shock, not even a single bubble of bubblewrap, and send it halfway arount the world, is it really a surprise that it arrives in pieces. And if the agent you had contact with have written it never arrived, instead of arriving broken. Do I know their protcol? I only assume it was an easier way, if they did?! to deal with it, I have certainly NOT asked them to do that, but I have a recollection of me discussing something I didn‚Äôt like, and person saying it was faster and easier that way.When you have ordered 40 items in one year,  and everything breakable breaks, and even a carton with steel stool(not assembled) was missing an entire corner and side of cardboard box. Is that really me as a customers flaw.After you experience a lot of this, and you are trying to be proactive, and ask about items before you buy, cause description is lacking. And you have been burned with buying wrong accessories, cause description did not say this item needed another size than the regular one. Having to use a lot of money to buy more, since not knowing before accessories ariving. They have no knowledge about items, and are trying to inform you with things that are written about item, that you read before taking the time to ask themü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, and they do not understand why you ask before buyingü§Ø And me beeing rude enough to say; sending me around and around among agents for 3 hours, while technical issues, me needing to wait, wanting me to begin from top, over and over, got me to cry, and feeling ghosted. And telling them my feelings! So now they are trying to turn it on me. I used to think they had the best customer service in the world, now this is the worst experience I have ever had, going from ghosting to trying to put blaime on me, for them not beeing able to pack properly. If you buy from them, I do hope you buy unbreakable stuff, and also do a lot of research beforehand, cause item describtion can be lacking, and do not waste your time on trying to chat and ask customer agents. How is it possible to fall so far from what they used to be, and even worse, only really bad customer service, goes after the customer.What happened to; you are a valued customer"

Today I received another cancellation of my order. Two of the three times I had their customer service person help me start to finish and I am calling them a fourth time tonight. If I did not have the gift card I would never order from them again.They assured me all three times it was all set and I would get the item. They have no idea what they are doing or they do not fully understand English who knows."
J Queen,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"The delivery times and range of Amazon products are great. However, my biggest complaint is the lack of after care sales by Amazon. You would be under the mercy of third party sellers (usually overseas sellers) who do not wish to comply with Australian Consumer Rights laws. Amazon washes their hands on any responsibility of the products they have sold and made a profit on when problems occur. I don't buy any more expensive electrical or electronic items from Amazon anymore because I have been caught many times."

RACHELLE JARVIS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Prime tv a joke. They are now asking for payments for virtually every box set, which they were not a year ago. If not lumbered with ever increasing ads.Their delivery service getting abysmal. Delivery men keep putting parcels in rubbish bins. We have nearly lost around 10 parcels. In addition having to retrieve parcels from a waste bin is not hygienic or pleasant.When you finally can get through to customer service after needing to trawl through useless FAQs and going round in circles you get some staff that are polite but talk over you. Prime is good cost wise, but tv is a scam. "
robert broadbent,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon simply doesn‚Äôt care anymore and the drivers are incompetent I have a delivery that was supposed to be delivered on 18th Dec to a friend then Amazon said it will be delivered on 19th and now no idea when or if it‚Äôs going to be delivered at all.My wife should have received a delivery today and it‚Äôs gone missing - it states handed to resident but it hasn‚Äôt Frankly sick of Amazon.
Devres Weekes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I placed an order. Seller cancels order and refunds. Amazon logistics ships order by accident. I refuse order. Amazon is now saying I have to wait 30 days for their item to reach their hub before I will get a refund. They admit it‚Äôs their error but said all they can do is apologize. I hope everyone reading this avoids using Amazon and use eBay instead or AliExpress. Amazon doesn‚Äôt care about its customers. This same seller also threatened that he got my address and name off Amazon‚Äôs seller platform and when I reported it they were more concerned with if I still wanted the item from him and then shipped it anyway ‚Äúby accident‚Äù when I said I didn‚Äôt. This is a disgusting company full of dishonest pathological liars who get a kick out of telling people there‚Äôs nothing they can do about their money being taken incorrectly. I‚Äôve now gotten my bank involved and all payments from Amazon will be declined. I also opened a chargeback and sent all the evidence to visa as Amazon abused the payment system. No wonder month by month their stock falls. They may seem like a big rich company but it‚Äôs only because of their inventory. Which 75% of it is made up of cheap dangerous products. When the public won‚Äôt invest in a company it says a lot about it. This is a dumpster fire of a pathetic company. I will make popcorn and laugh the day some pathetic executive gets on tv to cry as it fails. I also live in a block of flats and blocked Amazon web service accross the entire network at the router level so Amazon will lose thousands in ads every month.

An O. Nymous,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had a standard return for 2 items I received damaged due to extremely insufficient packaging. I returned the damaged items in 1 box per their provided return label. One items was scanned as returned, but never refunded, the other item in the same box didn't even get registered as returned. I have spent about 4 hours in amazon chats, being transferred to approx. 15 agents overall. None of them answered if they could see the return in their system, they kept asking ridiculous questions over and over again, hanging up the chat multiple times on me, It is a very standard return situation and it proved absolutely impossible to find out what is going on. In the end I was asked to submit an incident report, which never got answered or yielded any reaction whatsoever. This has been dragging out over 2 months. The chat won't even connect me anylonger (I am assuming the associates just won't answer by their choice, but gloss over it by keeping the chat active as though they are typing, but never answering). I was patient, ridiculously polite, solution-oriented and met with complete ignorance and incompetence. Worst of all, I wonder if any associate was able to actually work within their system. The majority seemed untrained, answered unsuitable and content-free phrases. I even doubt most of them had the intellect to actually process what was being asked. Sounds ridiculous? It feels like a different world shifted in subtle ways in that chat where none of the rules of the world as you know it apply. I used to absolutely love amazon and I shop pretty much all my needs online. Never have I had such a dismall experience even remotely like this encounter with amazon in my extensive online shopping history. Bizarre! Add to that 3 latest amazon deliveries were packaged unprofessionally  (products just tossed into huge boxes by the armful, some items survived the ordeal, others didn't). Amazon.com, RIP, it makes me sentimental to look back at the wonderful shopping experience that is now, and has been for a while, a ghost of the past."
Claire mccormack,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered a vanity table for my granddaughter from company called  allkindofthings  and it turned up damaged on 12th November  I sent it back the following day on 13 November recorded delivery which cost me ¬£18.55 and the company received it on 14th November and since then I kept contacting amazon got told wait until 21st November then that past and got told to wait until 13th December then contacted them yet again and I had to show proof I sent it and the company had received it and eventually got a refund on 16th December only for the item so I am ¬£18.55 out of pocket sending the item back and it took a month to sort out absolutely disgusting.   I haven't ordered anything since and very reluctant too.  If you send items at your own expense surely it should be refunded back.

BMac,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought a drum kit from Amazon for my daughters primary Christmas present. We gave her gift as we will be traveling for the holidays. The item came clearly used and defective. Cymbals had drum marks all over them. Drum heads and pieces were not in original packaging, but strewn about wrapped in old toilet paper packaging. As the item is heavy  I requested it be picked up. They said no one could pick it up until Dec 30th and that I would not receive my refund until then. So not only is the item used, it's broken - and my daughter is without a Christmas present and I'm without a large sum of money until they receive their defective item back after Christmas. When I communicated the issues to the customer service representative and expressed my displeasure with the impact this will have of my daughter not having her gift for Chirstmas, the rep hung up on me. Amazons service has gone so far down hill and I am shocked at the lack of empathy and how incredibly rude the rep was. Will be sure to share my experience, photos and reviews with everyone I know and everywhere possible. Once I receive my return I will be canceling my service and never using Amazon again. I have been using Amazon for over ten years, but this is the final nail in the coffin"

Peter Wanless,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I really do appreciate that it is the really busy time of year for the Amazon delivery team. However, it is with a sense of exasperation that again I saw a parcel was being left at my door and the driver not even ringing the doorbell. It is dark outside and all any ""porch thief"" or gang of ""porch thieves"" have to do is to follow the Amazon delivery van and ""collect"" the parcels left lying on the doorstep because the householder is not even aware that they are there. The last parcel that disappeared from my doorway contained an item costing nearly ¬£200. I no longer order expensive items from Amazon - not worth the risk."
Rhonda Guy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I was buying a lot of items last March and I didn't realize that several of the items I bought were from one seller in China.  I got a package with just 3 of the items and made multiple calls to the so-called service center (couldn't half understand the foreign agent) and finally thought it was resolved when the missing items showed up later on.  That should have been the end of it, but my troubles had just begun.  About a month later, I get a message from Amazon saying I have to return the items or my debit card will be charged.  After multiple equally frustrating phone calls to customer service (sigh), I get a message acknowledging that it was an Amazon error and that I didn't need to return anything and I wouldn't be charged.  Fortunately, I had enough sense not to trust them and I cancelled my debit card.  Unfortunately, I forgot I had a Visa card on file and they Did charge me (still on my card, still paying interest).  I made multiple additional phone calls and was told repeatedly they ""fixed"" it.  They didn't and no refund had been issued.  When I asked the last rep how could I be sure it was fixed, he flippantly told me I could believe it or not"".  As of this time (9 months later) they still have my money and I've got nothing.  Now they wonder why I refuse to buy from them.  Is anybody honest anymore? 1/24/2025 update; I still have the false charges on my Visa card (which I am paying interest on). I have officially said the hell with Amazon forever.  I don't do business with thieves.  And, remember:  This was 100 percent Amazon's error - not mine.  "

Charlotte B.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"With Amazon doing away with ""guaranteed 2 Day Shipping"". It's not really worth being a ""Prime"" member. Sure S&H is free. But, if the delivery time is going to be between 2-6 weeks for an item that Amazon has ""in stock"". You lose the ""convenience"" factor. They have also been splitting up deliveries. I order 2 pair of jeans and a personal journal in the same order. All 3 were sent out separately. And, I was told that I would have to wait for the 2nd pair of jeans, that were ""in stock"". So, I cancelled the order. What's worse is, that a ""shipping partner"" picks up the orders. But, then the USPS or UPS waits for the order to be brought to them. The shipping partner doesn't bring your order to the delivery company. They hold onto it for days or weeks. Gone are the days of true Customer Service. "
GIBBO,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"All good until it comes to delivery,  items are just thrown into the front step and left for anyone to see and steal I've contacted amazon about it but ifs still persists , what's the point of leaving items out in the open where they are st risk of being stolen , the last one was left in full view ,utterly hopeless "
Jane Hatch,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon.com are completely unhelpful. I ordered gifts for my family in America but the app defaulted to billing address, not delivery address I selected in America, ehich I didn't realise until parcels started arriving at my home address. I tried to contact customer services which was a nightmare as it just kept sending me back to the chatbot, which was not helping at all. Eventually managed to chat to an actual person who said they could not help until all the incorrectly addressed parcels have arrived. This will clearly be way too late for my family to get Christmas gifts on time. The customer service representatives simply do not care about helping you as a customer. I will not buy from Amazon.com again if I have any option at all as they just take your money and if they have created problems then refuse to help"

Paul Williams,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon as a service concept is awesome and he (Bezos) often meets expectations. My suggestion here is that their Customer Reviews of products are misleading as heck. I looked at a digital atomic self-setting wall clock which had a star rating of 4.7 out of 5. But reading the reviews reveals that dozens of them reported that the clock does not keep time reliably. A common theme of Amazon reviews is that they are not reliable. Reviewers often have no competence in understanding their product. I would be much more impressed if he implemented a department of independent professional reviewers, much like Consumer Reports used to be (I believe they are no longer completely independent & unbiased!) I need unbiased, competent assessments of products."

Jacek Oronski,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon UK, specifically its operations in the Hampshire region, demonstrates a deeply concerning lack of accountability in addressing delivery-related misconduct! Repeated instances have been documented involving misdelivery and criminal behavior by delivery personnel, including the theft of items from within parcels! These stolen parcels are then deceptively resealed and delivered, creating a false appearance of integrity!! Such actions fundamentally compromise the trust-distrust dynamic, a critical element in any consumer-business relationship.When these incidents are reported, Amazon UK exhibits a stance of deliberate ignorance. Complaints are routinely met with procedural deflection rather than substantive resolution, exposing a systemic failure to uphold corporate ethos and ethical responsibility. This behavior not only enables the continuation of such criminal acts but also reflects a severe inadequacy in Amazon UK‚Äôs recruitment, training, and oversight protocols within the Hampshire region.The company‚Äôs inaction in the face of these repeated and well-documented offenses highlights an alarming erosion of moral responsibility and operational accountability. For a corporation of its scale, one would expect the embodiment of transparency, reliability, and a customer-centric approach. Instead, its failure‚Äîor evident unwillingness‚Äîto adequately address these thefts perpetuates a climate of distrust and reveals significant vulnerabilities in its operational and ethical framework.These issues are far from isolated incidents. The existence of over 5,000 reported cases of misdelivery complaints and related theft underscores a pattern indicative of systemic neglect. Amazon UK‚Äôs persistent inaction in response to these complaints suggests a tacit tolerance of such practices, if not an outright prioritization of profits over consumer trust and ethical standards.For consumers within the Hampshire region, these observations demand vigilance and caution when engaging with Amazon UK‚Äôs services. The documented pattern of misconduct and the company‚Äôs apparent complicity through inaction present an unequivocal indictment of its operational and ethical shortcomings. This situation serves as a critical reminder of the consequences of unchecked corporate behavior, wherein the pursuit of profit overshadows the foundational principles of trust, morality, and accountability!Congratulations Amazon!

Jeffrey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered multiple products which would be delivered. After a few weeks the tracking page showed that the items were out fot delivery. After not receiving any product i contacted the customer service. They noticed to wait a few more days but the tracking page already shows the status  undeliverable. This went on a few more ytmes and they are poatponing and postponing everytime a few more days and weeks. After months i still dont have the prosucts and they won't give money back because i have to wait and wait. Never book here. Customerservice seems to be an A.I. generated book and unable to contact them in other ways to activate them to resend the money.
Jon Moorfoot,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"On the whole I would say I have had more good than bad experiences when ordering from Amazon, however the issue is that when there are problems they far outweigh the good, hence why I have only given 2 stars (if it was purely based on my latest issue I would only have given 1 star).I ordered some dog food the other day through Amazon Prime which was due to be delivered the next day. On the day of delivery I received an email saying they would be unable to deliver the item so I logged into my account to check the tracking to find out the item had been damaged at my local Amazon depot and so was being returned to the warehouse. I phoned Amazon to see what my options were as most companies would arrange for a replacement to be sent on it straight away if they were unable to deliver due to something within their own control. I was advised by the customer services agent that the only had the option to refund and not have the item resent. As if it wasn't bad enough that Amazon would not automatically have the option to resend the item straight away to make up for their mistake I was advised that a refund would also not be instant and even via their quickest refund option of it going back on to a gift card balance it could take up to 4-5 hours. This really isn't acceptable as they take the money instantly at the time of order and if they are unable to deliver due to their own fault th money should be refunded right away as they are not having to wait to check anything.By the time I had the refund processed, although the item was still available on Prime delivery the expected delivery date was not until 4 days later (as opposed to next day which was offered up until 30 mins before the refund processed. As I had received the refund via a gift balance so as not to have to wait 5-7 days to get my money back I placed the order again and then immediately spoke to customer services to see if the could expedite the despatch date as a gesture of good will for messing up the original order. After the agent spoke to their supervisor they advised they would put a not on the order to get it despatched ASAP.The next day the order was still not showing despatched so I spoke to Amazon customer services once again, who advised a note been added to have the order despatched sooner and that it would be despatched either that day or the following morning. Surprise surprise the next day the order had still not updated to being despatched so I spoke to Amazon CS again to advise that I was not happy that 2 previous agents had advised me the order despatch would be sped up and it still hadn't. The best they would offer me is a ¬£5 voucher as an apology and advised that they would request the despatch would be sped up but couldn't guarantee it would (at least they did not lie this time).When a company messes up they should be doing their best to make the issue right as quickly as possible not making it take even longer and providing false hope that they are trying to rectify the issue.Any company can have issues or make a mistake and that is completely understandable but how they deal with that is what defines them. The fact that Amazon don't automatically offer to resend an item they have damaged and certainly don't try to get it sent out as soon as possible as a gesture of goodwill shows that Amazon really have little to no respect for their customers and only care about the money they make off of them.I feel sorry for the customer service team who have to deal with the complaints with very little tools to actually solve them sufficiently whilst those above them that set the rules and put the systems on place earn a lot more money without having to be on the frontline."

PT,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Used to like Amazon, but they're getting worse, MUCH worse.1). Delivery drivers NEVER follow delivery instructions. Despite stating ""Do NOT leave items on the doorstep"" and providing alternative delivery instructions, they still leave items on the doorstep. üôÑ2). There's a bug in their Android app where a 'wish list' shared via Messenger will not open properly & simply states 'You don't have a profile'(!) Spent HOURS on the phone trying to explain this one to them.3). They now implement 'dynamic pricing' meaning the price of any item may depend upon 'customer behaviour' i.e. they may adjust the price (usually upwards!) if they think they can charge you more for it!! Two people looking at the same item may see two TOTALLY different prices!!4). Their customer support is becoming abysmal. They're usually located in some other part of the world & totally disingenuous. It's a nightmare to explain anything and incredibly difficult to maintain any continuity over any single issue.If you order anything from Amazon, you can only hope it arrives safely & isn't faulty.You've been warned!!"
Em.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In October 2024, I made my first order of Amazon. A month later, two days before delivery: It said ‚Äúreturning back to the store‚Äù It took approximately a month for the payback to get to me and I didn‚Äôt get any information about what happened to my order. No compensation at all, bad customer ‚Äúchat‚Äù service, told me to reorder the items‚Ä¶When I had gotten the money back, I ordered again, with higher hopes. Three days before delivery: again, one of three items said ‚Äúreturning back to the store, problem occured‚Äù. Since I needed the item, I very soon ordered a new one of it, and paid very expensive taxes and shipping cost, even though that‚Äôs was already paid for in the first order. The customer service told me nothing could be done differently from their side. This means a total of 50 USD, in shipping, with only three items. Parted in two orders‚Ä¶Since they made on of them go back to the store. I was not happy about this. So, It now said all the items were going to be delivered, and one of them - a month later than the other two. The least they could do in this place would be sending me a new one of the items that they couldn‚Äôt ship, and give me a compensation. The only thing they did was making me pay more. So, what happens two days later? The two items from the first order tells me ‚Äúreturning back to the store, problem occured‚Äù. At this point it‚Äôs so bad that I fully want to cancel the latest order with only one item. I will never order from them again, the service is the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. The customer service chat is very bad, you need to get really angry in order for them to even make something. But it‚Äôs very little to no help that they can give‚Ä¶So in total, I‚Äôve made 3 orders with many items. Have I got any order of them? No. Have I got any information? No. Have I got any compensation? No. Have I spent much money and TIME? YES. Will I ever buy from them again? Yes - If I want the baddest experience possibly! Of course! Will I share this with friends and family? Yes!! Thank you for such an awful experience and for never getting my products."
Paul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon itself is normally a great way to access a whole variety of products with ease‚Ä¶ however their delivery service is among the worst to exist on this bloody planet! Honestly I‚Äôve never seen anything so bad in my life! They just hire anyone of the street and they just couldn‚Äôt care less about the products they are handling! Stuff gets broken and smashed to pieces and if it manages to actually make it to your door‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt even knock to give it to you! They just throw it on the floor and leave! Resulting in stolen parcels or soaked through due to the rain! They need to train their staff properly because I‚Äôve now had to resort to informing them how to do their jobs correctly myself

The second time their agent stated"" it's on the van and is only a short distance from your home"" a total lie, confirmed later by another agent.

Jon Swallow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I purchased a 3D Printer and insurance for it at the time. The coverage on the insurance was way less than the printer. Why did Amazon sell me this insurance to cover a much more expensive item? Used car salesmen have more honor. It is no accident that they sold me the wrong insurance. The rep on the chat even confirmed the insurance was for that product. 
Ben Wapshott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely useless customer service. My account was hacked, multiple purchases made and shipped to an address not even in my country, and the run around trying to get this resolved has been exhausting. Transferred from customer service 'associate' to 'associate' without ever actually finding a resolution. I cant even speak with someone directly, as I am in Australia, and the purchase was made on the US platform, and its impossible to request a call back if not on a +1 phone code, and when contacting the Australian Amazon customer service line, they tell me they cannot help. For a multi-billion dollar company to have such a poor excuse of a customer service process is down right negligent. Also, for someone to be able to hack into my account, make a purchase on a completely different platform than I've ever used, and have it sent to an address in a different county, without it raising any flags, clearly shows they actually don't care about implementing proper security measures to avoid this type of thing taking place. If you ever have any issues with Amazon, do NOT expect their sorry excuse for a customer service team to be remotely helpful. Honestly, I would not be surprised if everyone I have chatted with have been an AI script, and a poor one at that."

Isabell Christofferson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Disappointing Customer Service and Lack of AccountabilityI‚Äôve been a long-time Amazon customer, but my recent experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. I ordered a backdrop stand on Black Friday pricing, but Amazon sent me the wrong item. Instead of making things right, they put me through hours of repetitive and unhelpful customer service interactions.Despite the item I originally ordered still being listed as available for sale, I was told it couldn‚Äôt be replaced. Instead, I‚Äôm required to return the wrong item before receiving a refund, which could take up to 30 days. This process is not only inconvenient but completely disregards the fact that Amazon made the mistake in the first place.Even after escalating the issue through multiple channels, including customer service and Amazon‚Äôs social media team, I received generic responses with no accountability. Amazon‚Äôs representatives, including Lydia from their social media team, were dismissive and unwilling to provide meaningful solutions.This experience has been exhausting, and I‚Äôve since canceled my Prime membership. I will no longer shop with Amazon or use any of its associated services. Their lack of accountability, poor customer service, and unwillingness to fix their mistakes are unacceptable.I would strongly caution others to think twice before relying on Amazon, especially if you expect competent customer service or fair treatment."

I gave them my ID which I was hesitant about, but they keep asking for it again and again. I have read other reviews that people are waiting weeks to months to get their money or their product after giving ID! I‚Äôve called 47 times. I‚Äôve been hung up on by everyone along with being laughed at and sworn at. This includes supervisors! If they have their way, I will never get my money or product ever. This is theft.

I called several times, and the responce was utter nonsence. Then,my credit card co. allerted me that Amazon was charging me various $ amounts on my card. I had to claim fraud, and stopped payments. These Amazon people are Extremely Dishonest. They told me my $110 was sent on the 3rd of November. Which is a big lie. They even tried to scam money from my bank card. I had to change cards.

Carl Taylor,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Amazon really needs to get more humans involved in their customer service.  I ordered a package that was coming from the UK and as a result is now stuck in Canada Post strike action (Ordered before I knew there was going to be a strike).  I contacted the seller a couple of times and of course there isn't much they could do but I was worried about my A - Z Guarantee from Amazon since the item is going to arrive so late I wanted to know I would still have return options in case of an issue etc...  I entered in my query in the customer service module and the bot instantly awarded me a refund rather than passing me on to a human who would have assured me that they would maintain my guarantees in the event there was an issue.  Now the seller is out the money and I will likely receive the package at some time in the future.  It's too bad that Amazon let's you rate on their site the sellers, the products and pretty much everything else except for Amazon themselves.  They don't seem to want to know (Or at least put in a way that it is displayed) on their site what people actually think of them."
Yanick,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Worst support ever. I wanted to find out why I couldn't claim Twitch drops or why the Amazon Gaming stuff wasn't delivered. Everything went well at first, until the gentleman from the live chat started wrapping everything up. Without helping me with this. So now I have even more questions than before. I have no loot and I paid for nothing. If I could give 0 stars I would definitely do so."

Robin Alford,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer for years. I have noticed a rapid decline in customer service, fulfillment speed, and Prime Video. The last straw was just last week. I ordered three t-shirts that were sold and shipped by Amazon. Two hours after I placed the order, I decided to cancel it. TWO HOURS! When I canceled the order, a message popped up that they were unable to cancel. WTF? The package hasn't even shipped yet! The next morning, I called customer service and spoke to a woman with a Hindi accent. She assured me that the order had been canceled and I would receive a refund in ""5 to 7 business days."" I checked the tracking on the Amazon website to make sure they didn't ship it. They did. It arrived today. Now, I have to start a return and take it to a UPS shipping store, which will cost me time and gas money. I better get my refund because I plan to cancel my Amazon account. It's just not worth the hassle. Amazon Prime Video charges for the majority of its programming. They charge for each show/movie with very few free videos so it is no longer worth it. I will return my business to the local stores. At least with them, the return policy won't be a hassle, especially when you are looking them in the eye."

Tison Howerter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Two straight days item was supposed to arrive and both days at ten o'clock at night amazon changes it to now arriving at a later date. Both days it said the driver had the item but never showed up. I just went ahead and cancelled the order and bought it from best buy. Amazon prime is a waste of money. Shipping was so much better when Amazon dropped the items at USPS and they made the final delivery. Never had this issue until Amazon took over the whole process. From now on I will order everything from other companies and Amazon prime will be one less expense.
andrew seal,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered an Ottoman bed off Amazon the supplier was sleep factory Wakefield I ordered this on Black Friday deal I ordered on the 1st of December. The advert said will be delivered Wednesday the fourth did not receive on the Wednesday the fourth I contacted Amazon who said it been delayed I would receive it on the Thursday did not receive on the Thursday contacted Amazon again. I said to me unable to deliver bulky items at the present time. Will email me when they can deliver on the Saturday, the 7th of December. I still had no email find them again and they said it will arrive Wednesday not happy so I contacted appetising standard agency because the advert was still showing three day delivery that was not the case on Tuesday. I received an email saying to be delivered Wednesday/Thursday so I contacted Amazon again and asked for the Pacific day as I work and it needed to be signed for and I did not want it left outside in the wet phone again Thursday who said it was delayed I will be delivered Friday that is no good to me as I‚Äôm at work Fridays so ask them to deliver it Saturday morning. I said they would give me a refund as I sorry but no refund putting into my account I would advise people if I have the same problem to contact the  ASA the more people that do this something might be done.

m dyer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon seems to be getting worse, which is sad as I used them alot but now only use them as a last resort. Every black friday and run up to Christmas I have issues with the delivery drivers, they either nick my items by swapping an expensive item with a cheap product (as they need a code therefore know its a pricey item) / don't bother delivering or they deliver to the wrong address. Though I have told Amazon of my frustrations, I get the standard reply of its been escalated internally and it will be resolved... it never is. I understand the drivers have alot of parcels at this time of year but Amazon need to seriously start sorting the issue, whether that be reducing the workload or secret traps for those drivers with slippery fingers.After my items don't turn up, I then get the joy of contacting Amazon and explaining my issue and being told a refund will be returned in 5 working days, not only have I got to wait agee for a refund, I miss out on the deals that I wanted.

The chat keeps telling me to ""wait 48 hours"" I wait 48 hours, no refund go back on have to explain the whole situation again, get told ""wait 2/3 business days"" I do this and the cycle continues. Over 2 months now to get our money back. It is over 1000 euro! I would urge people not to use this company, we will never be using it again. Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. "

Anonymous Reviewer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought some seat covers from amazon. Once the seat covers arrived they did not fit my seats despite being advertised for my vehicle model. Once, I tried returning the item the seller informed me that I would have to pay to ship the return back. I contacted amazon customer service regarding this issue and they escalated me to a supervisor where they assured me that amazon would fully reimburse me the $230 that it cost me to ship my return long as I sent them a copy of my receipt. Once I got this confirmation I shipped my return out. I then contacted amazon and an agent told me that due to amazon policy I would not be eligible to be reimbursed the full amount but instead only be reimbursed  $150. After 2 weeks of going back and forth I had no choice than to accept defeat. Also, my return had already arrived back to the seller days had passed and I was still not issued a refund for the original cost of the seat covers. Amazon customer service is useless and they do not care about their customers. After speaking to multiple agents each agent told me something different every time. I know the calls are recorded so I asked them to review the recording but obviously they are not going to do that since it hurts their image."

To contact us about this decision, please email --redacted--."" - AmazonBack about 5 years ago , I purchased a couple security systems from Amazon. Now it's no secret that 100% of these are cheap Chinese garbage security systems. So I had tried a few and returned them until I found one worth keeping (secret: none of them are worth keeping)I ended up leaving reviews for these Chinese security systems, all of them negative, because they are the worst devices in terms of security and I wanted to warn other buyers about them. They all use open WIFI networks, thus turning your wifi into an open network that anyone can use. This brings along with it an issue of not only users using your network for free, but also an attacker could use it to break into your network. They already have access to your network, now all they need to do is break into your PC.These cheap Chinese security cameras have introduced countless vulnerabilities into my network. So I figured I would warn people by leaving a negative review.What happened? Either:- the Chinese seller(s) complained they got a negative review and Amazon banned me- Amazon didn't like the negative review and banned mePersonally I think it is the former, the Chinese seller who only wants 5 star reviews complained that they got a 0/1 star review and Amazon banned me. This has an effect of astroturfing the reviews for that seller. Every time they get a negative review the seller flags your account and Amazon bans you from reviews, thus giving them the appearance of having many 5 star reviews and 0 x 0 star reviews. Now you know why Chinese sellers are 5 stars average. Not only that, the sellers ask you to leave 5 star reviews only , and will give a discount in exchange for it, which should be against Amazon's TOS/TOU.Unfortunately (for Amazon) over the past 5-10 years I've purchased over $10,000 worth of products from them. Just this year alone, I've spent between $3,000 and $4,000 and purchased 12 products - none of which are Chinese or came from a Chinese seller. All of them came from Amazon sellers based outside of China.Unfortunately for every non-Chinese seller on Amazon, Amazon has decided to ban me for making a few well deserved negative reviews on cheap Chinese security systems that introduce vulnerabilities to your network.I was going to leave glowing positive reviews for each of the 12 recent purchases, and so I contacted Amazon to return my ability to write reviews because I have good reviews to leave, and customers should not be banned simply for leaving a negative review.Unfortunately again for Amazon, they have decided to keep my account banned even though that Chinese seller probably no longer exists and has changed their name to get away from negative reviews like they always do.The end result is not only Amazon suffers by losing 12 glowing positive reviews to protect a Chinese seller selling garbage with holes throughout. But also the consumer loses out, by not having accurate reviews to base their purchase decision off of.TLDR; Amazon is astroturfing reviews for Chinese sellers, and if you leave a negative review you are risking being banned like I am.Also note they are astroturfing the subreddit r/Amazon as my postings are removed almost immediately.I've bought many amazing products from Amazon, and so this only hurts Amazon and it's consumers. Now at least 12 sellers are missing 5 star positive reviews that they've earned the hard way.Trustpilot: Why can't I put less than or greater than? Wtf? Also a rich text input box would be nice ..."

Jen Clements,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"To be honest 1 star is being generous.We ordered a bed frame, paid extra to have the bed delivered on a day that was convenient and to also have it put together to save me lots of stress post major surgery.I remained in from 7am -7pm as requested, checked regularly for updates - nothing. 7pm nothing! Contacted Amazon said oh yes we knew there was an issue this morning and no one thought to contact me. Promised a call back from a manager (never happened) and told the item would be delivered the following day and I would receive a phone call the following morning before midday to give me a time for delivery. Made contact with Amazon twice that day and promised on both occasions someone would contact me and that they were going to raise a complaint. More than a week on the beds still not been delivered and we are unable to get a refund! We have spent some much time making calls trying to get our money back - the item hasn‚Äôt materialised and that‚Äôs not our fault! The advisors have made empty promises and they still have our money having told us we won‚Äôt be receiving the item!!! The last customer service advisor was unable to process the refund despite knowing this is the only option. It‚Äôs been far more stressful than we ever anticipated. No one wants to respond to my emails, no one contacts us back when promised, raised the issues through the chat function which is useless. I‚Äôve rearranged my schedule and appointments to be at home three days as requested by Amazon to take delivery.

I know that sometimes there can be a delay in delivery by a day or two. My problem is that it was supposed to be delivered today and it not only wasn't delivered today it hasn't even been shipped and the only thing that is stated about the delivery is that I will be notified when it ships. It doesn't even give me a projected date on the shipping now. It also tells me that I cannot cancel it. Like I said I wouldn't mind at all and I would understand that was just a matter of my delivery date being set back a day or two but the fact that this hasn't even been shipped yet on the day that was actually projected to be delivered and I seem to have no recourse on this at all."

Instead they lie about the delivery date and every day they extend the delivery time. I see NO reason to have prime. Hardly anything arrives the following day. I despise buying foreign junk.

Kelvin Foulkes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I personally feel extremely let down by Amazon of late. I've spent a good amount of money with them in the past two years. My accounts with them have always been impeccable, but whilst on holiday, one of my cards expired without be realising for one of three of Amazon Payment Plans I had in place. One payment was late by a day and a half by the time I had noticed. So not only did I pay the late payment and updated my account with the new card, I completely paid off all three in one go. Since that one late payment, I no longer have the Amazon payment plans as I've been measured by their AI and deemed unworthy. By all accounts, there is no option for human intervention when it comes to this so not only am I being judged by a computer now, it would seem that this computer is above all staff members including Management who rudely cut me off during a chat and confirmed that he has no control. Is this a sign of the future where all humans are judged by zeros and ones with no intervention by a friendly face who can see reason? I've currently got Prime, Audible, Blink and Alexa with with Amazon and I'm seriously considering cancelling the lot because I so very disappointed in them and the lack of care for their customers."
Rubi Wong,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Worst shopping experience with Amazon Canada!I placed an order for a watch over 1k and what did I receive? A damaged box with absolutely NO watch inside! This is completely unacceptable.When I reached out for help, the customer service I received was the worst I have ever encountered. They insist that I need to file a police report for a situation that is clearly a civil matter! The police won't accept a report because this has nothing to do with them. It's outrageous that Amazon cannot handle their orders properly.Additionally, every response I've received from their agents has been nothing but copy-pasted replies that do not address my issue at all. This is beyond frustrating.I truly believe that Amazon has really bad business practices, especially when it comes to return items. When you return an item, oftentimes they don't even look to make sure the item is in the box or that the correct item is in the box. They also usually don't even look to make sure that the item in the box is in a condition to sell again!If they receive a return that is for a reason other than that it doesn't work then they just add it back to their stock and it gets shipped out to the next customer."

Chris Karickhoff,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought two axles as a set from TRQ through Amazon. I only received one. I let both know I did not receive the second axle. TRQ said there was nothing they could do until 30 days had passed and to contact Amazon. Amazon said to contact TRQ. Then Amazon said to return the part. Yeah, that's right, return the good one I got and the one I did not receive. I said I installed the axle on the customers car and bought another from somewhere else to finish the job. I only wanted half my money back. They then proceeded to put me in an infinity loop of idiocy and kept telling me to send in the broken part. They did not listen. When I threatened to report the fraud they deleted the last chat I was having and ghosted me. I told both Amazon and TRQ that I was calling my bank and reporting them and requesting half my money back. As soon as I did that they both emailed to see why. REALLY? I went through all the gyrations again just to be told Amazon could not help me and TRQ said I should have contacted them in less than 30 days so no refunds. They said this on the email chain that showed I did so several times. Unreal. It is a scam by both. All over wanting a $77 refund for a part I never received. Proof is the Amazon delivery driver picture. SMH."

We had our engineer attend and the motor was clicking every time it went through a cycle.  We sent Amazon the call out charge and they put us in contact with Arc their claims handlers (utterly dreadful company) and they agreed to pay the call out charge but wanted to do so in 'full and final settlement'.  Given the motor was not still clicking we agreed with our engineers to monitor the motor and of course it has now subsequently failed. With the initial call out, a second to replace the motor and reconfigure it our bill stands at ¬£1101, and now Amazon after six months have decided to pass us to the courier firms insureres to resolve the problem! Sorry not equitable, you are the retailer, my contract is with you and your couriers are your problem! Be warned, Amazon the multibillion dollar retailer doesn't give a damn about their couriers, what damage they cause at your home and its down to you to fix it, they aren't interested one little bit!"

Jacquie ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very poor delivery. Recently, I've had problems with all my drliveries. They have all been late. One item ordered wasn't even put through Amazon system. Another item, delivery failed because the driver so called couldn't get access, but I was home waiting for my delivery. When you contact the chat line you get put through from one Amazon associate to the next and they all give you generic apology messages. No one actually answers question directly or resolves issues. You may as well be speaking to a computer. The customer service centre is very incompetent."
Cameron,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon fail to fulfill pre orders for physical media.  This past year i've had 3 pre orders made months apart fail because Amazon don't stock enough. They don't tell me either and I have to find out for myself when they don't ship the items. They were 4K and DVD sets. Amazon pre orders aren't guaranteed. Never pre ordering anything off Amazon.com ever again! Abysmal

Tara,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my account access experience. After being repeatedly locked out of my account, I have spent months attempting to rectify this situation to no avail. Today, I spent two hours before work on the phone with customer service and one hour after returning home to merely access what Amazon bills me for. What adds to my frustration is that I pay for my annual service and Amazon Music, which I am currently locked out of. However, Amazon continues to bill me for services they know I cannot access. It's unacceptable to be charged for something I can't use.To make matters worse, customer service has been of zero help. Each time I reached out for assistance, I received vague responses that didn‚Äôt address my concerns. It felt like I was going in circles without real guidance on resolving the issue.I am appalled and outraged by the recurring lockouts, lack of support, and billing practices. After over 20 years with Amazon, it is now time to move on."

Emily King,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It's a shame we have to rate with stars so 1nit is . The very fact that Amazon Prime was founded in  February 2, 2005. And the service's internal codename was ""Futurama"". Is laughable , seen as they can't progress. This very  project was started in part by a software engineer who was frustrated with Amazon's free-shipping offer at the time, which was called Super Saver Shipping. And yes I can understand why he was frustrated because let's face it we are in the future and they still can't get the shipping right,  I mean for the very fact that the current Amazon logo depicts the absolute message that they sell everything from A to Z. And they can ship these in good time with subscriptions of prime membership is a joke, they can't communicate on this day in age a delay for a service as a consumer Untill you question this , and their response is to stick as a good will gesture ¬£5 Credit on your account, without asking, yes lack of communication they have the software to do this we are not in 2005 we are almost in 2025 that's 20 years and they still can't get it right , the problem you see lies between that chair and keyboard. I understand that delivery on next day can be up to 10pm but when one order is despatched due say Mon ordered on the sat same day as the order due on sun next and the Sunday one hasn't still being dispatched at 10pm , that is ridiculous.. and then the call/ chat handler on receipt of email sent a email and had chased the wrong order , he chased up Monday's delivery not the one in question. Leaves me to wonder ü§î if they need to go back to school for basic training and reading of complaints and issues because how can you get it wrong on so many levels , but don't worry I will stick to eBay in the future. Sincerely "" Futurama"" to eBay ."
babablacksheep,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've called my bank they tell me everything's fine. Payment is made. I thought it was weird the money for the order is still in my bank account. Still have not touched that money but payment declines. The thing is I used another card before, my sister's card (because I could order internationally with her card) for the same order on my other account because I couldn't login into my original account because for some weird reason, I couldn't get the sms code to login to my old account. So maybe the bank and amazon think it's fraud. It's not. We all consented to it. She even called the bank for this order and her bank said it was fine. Anyway, same problem. Which is why I tried extra hard to get my old account back and make this order with my renewed debit card. Still this happened to me. So I checked reddit. I found out they only charge when shipment is made. So I have to make sure there's sufficient funds until it is shipped but order still hasn't shipped. Declines even when there's enough funds in bank account. Is it a limit issue? I did not exceed any limit. Now they have to move the arrival date. Again. Guess what? Still not shipped. It's been days. Is this going to happen again? Just charge me immediately once the payment is made. "

It‚Äôs like a game of hot potato where the customer loses every time.Whenever I have to return an item‚Äîeven when Amazon is at fault for sending damaged or used goods‚ÄîI‚Äôm forced to pay a $6.99 return fee. Why should I be penalized for their mistakes?To make matters worse, their representatives consistently fail to understand even the most basic instructions, like the difference between a UPS Drop-Off Point and a UPS Store Drop-Off. I‚Äôve had to explain this multiple times, and instead of resolving the issue, they just transferred me to someone else who‚Äôs equally unhelpful. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and feels like they don‚Äôt value their customers.Amazon, as one of the largest companies in the world, this level of incompetence is unacceptable.

He replied ""yes but there was no reply on the intercom"" I told him that he needed to press 178 and I would buzz him in but he said ""no I have other delivery s now"" I told him that I would complain and he said ""Okay but you have to come down and get it.This is an item that I cannot even  lift and told him about my age and that I was disabled and he needed to bring it up to me.But he refused and made me go down  two floors and along the corridor to the main entrance.I opened the door and told him that I would complain and he told me it was my fault not his. I explained that in my delivery instructions it even says come down the path to the left the dial ""178"" into the key panel,but he kept telling me it was my fault even though I showed him by the keypad that it said put a 1 before the flat numbers. I was very angry. He then said he needed the security passcode which I then gave him. He the said he needed to scan the the barcode. Followed by ""now there's no signal"". He would not bring it up for me and left.Then I had to drag it along the corridor to the lift then up two floors and then drag it to me flat which is at the end of that corridor. I then had to go and take some lorazepam to calm down.I phone amazon to complain and a nice lady with a strong accent offered me ¬£10 compensation after I requested some after continually have these problems with the company. I consider this an insult.Is this really all my time and stress is worth. I am sick of your company.Ali Express seems to get everything here with no issues.Time and again I need to complain and you keep thinking you can weasel out of this with a maximum compensation of ¬£30. Not this time enough is enough. You have to do better than that. You treat us all like cattle fodder no clients.Rev.Barrie Smith.""Then it turned out that after a week the nozzle became faulty. Rather than making Amazon go to the expense of coming and getting the machine then having to send out another one I phone customer services and told them that the nozzle was faulty and could I get the NOZZLE replaced and the lady said ""we would like to put ¬£50 on your gift card as a good will gesture"". And if you listen to the phone call you will hear me say "" this ¬£50 has nothing to do with my complaint about the delivery does it?"" And she replied ""No it has nothing to do with your complaint"". So I accepted and as soon as it was in my account I ordered a new nozzle with that money. Since then Amazon has on two occasions offered a full refund of ¬£399. But being an honest person I pointed out that I had after problems with the delivery and dragging the 20KG machine to my flat I did have the item. Then its "" Oh no you have had ¬£50 that's all we can offer"". Your company is disgraceful. Over the years I have purchase 10 of thousands of pounds worth of products from you but have had continual problems with delivery s because the delivery people cannot read English or don't have enough time to deliver. To my knowledge some delivery people just dump delivery s in fields. I have Asperger's,a heart issue and osteoarthritis.But you are happy to make me stay in for three days now waiting for phone calls that you email me will come that day but never come. You don't give shit about my health or customer relations. I should have kept my mouth shut and taken the ¬£399 refund but unfortunately my morals are at a much higher level than yours."

David Irby,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Amazon customer service is hit and miss.  Often, an agent will lie to you when it comes to refunds.  They will tell you the refund has been processed when it hasn't, so you have to go back on the website and repeat the refund request process with another agent, who may also lie to you.  On my last experience with Amazon customer service, the first two agents swore that my refund had been processed.  I then spoke to a supervisor, who told me that the first agent's request 'glitched' and the second agent's request was never processed.  The supervisor then put through the refund request and provided me proof before I would leave the chat.You have to watch these people like a hawk.  Always ask for confirmation when Amazon agents tell you that your refund has been processed.  (It will show up on your order, but make them show it to you.)"

I contacted Amazon using the chat wanting to arrange a collection but the associate said it didn't need returning. I asked them several times and each time they replied with, 'No, it doesn't need returning'. This morning I received an email from Amazon saying they want it back. I contacted Amazon using the chat and not one of the three associates I spoke to understood what I was saying. They were rude, no customer service and had a 'Can't be bothered' attitude. I said I wanted to make a complaint but was told that only they deal with complaints. How can you complain to the very same people you're complaining about(?). I'm so annoyed. All I wanted was to know why I was advised incorrectly and to arrange a collection. What was so difficult for them to understand. Apparently the associates can't access chat history so you need to start again with Evri conversation. They also need the customer to do all the work in finding the order numbers etc and then ask if you're still connected when you're trying to find it! Amazon are too big a company to care about their customers. I doubt anything with the diminishing customer service will change."

The refund deadline was later shifted to 13th December, despite evidence the item was lost.Failure to Escalate: Amazon failed to resolve the issue with Reliant or ArrowXL, forcing me to pursue direct contact with the seller.Reliant (The Seller)Failure to Dispatch: Reliant failed to release the TV to ArrowXL. Reliant‚Äôs system shows the order as ""pending"", confirming that the item was never released to the courier.No Transparency: Reliant only responded after I contacted them via customer service email and left a review on Trustpilot.Payment Issue: Reliant provided Amazon's message, which incorrectly claimed that payment authorization was incomplete. This was factually incorrect, as the payment of ¬£888 was debited on 3rd December.ArrowXL (The Courier)No Custody of the TV: ArrowXL confirmed they never received the TV, and since Reliant‚Äôs system shows the order as ""pending"", it‚Äôs clear that ArrowXL is not at fault in this case.No Proactive Updates: Despite being the assigned courier, ArrowXL failed to communicate the non-receipt of the package proactively.Accountability FailuresFalse Payment Claims: Reliant and Amazon falsely claimed payment authorization was incomplete, despite the payment being successfully debited from my account on 3rd December.False Delivery Claims: The TV was listed as ""damaged in transit"" (according to Amazon) and ""pending dispatch"" (according to Reliant), while ArrowXL confirmed it was never received.Broken Refund Promises: Amazon promised a refund within 24 hours on 3rd December, but then delayed it to 13th December, despite clear evidence that the TV was not dispatched.Impact on Me as a CustomerEmotional DistressThe TV was a Christmas gift, and as we approach Christmas, the chance of finding a replacement is rapidly decreasing. This has caused emotional stress, especially since delays are likely to increase as Christmas approaches.Financial Strain¬£888 was debited from my bank account on 3rd December, but no refund has been issued. This financial strain has limited my ability to purchase a replacement gift.Breach of TrustAmazon provided a written assurance of a refund to be processed within 24 hours, but this was not honored. This has eroded my trust in Amazon, Reliant, and ArrowXL.Consumer Rights ViolationsFailure to Deliver GoodsUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the seller (Reliant) is responsible for ensuring delivery. As Reliant never released the TV to the courier, this is a clear breach of their legal obligation.Withholding Refunds Without JustificationUnder the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, refunds must be issued without undue delay. The delay until 13th December is unlawful since the TV was never dispatched.Breach of Written AssuranceOn 3rd December, Amazon provided written assurance that a refund would be processed within 24 hours, which was not done. This constitutes a potential breach of obligations under the Misrepresentation Act 1967.Final ThoughtsThis experience demonstrates a complete failure of accountability from Amazon, Reliant, and ArrowXL.Reliant failed to release the TV for dispatch.Amazon falsely claimed payment authorization was incomplete, even though ¬£888 was debited on 3rd December.Amazon broke its written promise of a refund within 24 hours.Escalation Plan: Complaint to Trading Standards, chargeback request, and media exposure via BBC, Guardian & more."
Maria Whiteside,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could do an 0 star I would! Amazon has definitely gone down. I do not receive purchases or the products are broken. There has been 1 instance when I recieved a broke item. I did not know it was broken and I got cut really badly. I threw out the item. I contact Amazon immediately sent the necessary pictures. They refused my refund. Another time my purchase was ‚Äúin my mailbox‚Äù. It  was not. I went all over my neighborhood and I couldn‚Äôt find it. They refused my refund or give me a replacement. Products have been ruined or sizes not accurate. It has been horrible! I even wrote a review and they would not post it. Walmart and target have actually been cheaper and I do not need to worry about damage or issues with returns. 
Robert,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought a product off Amazon by a company called Spartan root activator shampoo. What I received was a clone that copied the packaging and print on the bottle to a tee. It wasn‚Äôt until much later when I saw an online warning about clones of this product , that I realized that‚Äôs what Amazon sold me. The clone is called eelhoe They tried to pin the blame back on me saying I should have researched the third party supplier they used to make sure it was legitimate. And also said it was past the grace period for them to do anything to make it right. Amazon buyer beware, they don‚Äôt stand behind their suppliers. Well at least Jeff got his money right? "

Les Ens,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has gotten so bad these days that almost none of my orders were delivered since they switched over to using Intelcom otherwise known as Dragonfly to ship customer orders. I have cancelled my Prime membership as it is mostly useless now since most often cannot get my order delivered to my home anymore. Dragonfly keeps losing my orders. Amazon used to be reliable. They are quickly losing their reputation for delivery on time. For delivering at all these days.

Peter Cassomini,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Explaining a bit further on what I meant yesterday Amazon Mr Bezos extremely wealthy man has devised a way of earning interest on other people‚Äôs money without any real effort. I bought the ninja slow cooker on the 24th of November. I refused it because driver was so rude it went back to Depot phoned Amazon customer service which is a joke to talk to a talk to a human being is nearly impossible after 30 minutes I got through asking where my ¬£113.99 was apology apology apology my theory is that they hold onto your money as long as possible. If I had not checked my bank statement I would be none the wiser now I am just one of many the Amazon owe money to someone should investigate how much money they‚Äôve got lying around which they don‚Äôt have to pay interest on this is to clarify what I was saying yesterday I was a bit upsetand really really annoyed with because still no apology and though the company in general is very good this is one aspect that is very very poor. My name is Peter Cassomini and if Amazon wants to make a comment, I would be interested. Thank you very much."
Nemesis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Been using Amazon for nearly 20 years and seen it get worse day by daythey are over run by scammer sellers who advertise one product and send a cheaper item/versionexample i ordered old Jamaica ginger beer original the listing showed images and ingredients of the original i even contacted the seller before buying and they confirmed the original.i ordered and paid and 4 days later i receive the cheaper regular version with sweeteners that tastes absolutely disgusting.i called the seller out who gave me every excuse in the book and Amazon gave me a warning about returns and would not accept a return unless i provide a government form of id.i know my consumer rights in the uk and explained them to Amazon and selling as Amazon uk have to abide by uk trading laws..don't send Amazons third party company your photographed id... i have reported several sellers for sending items not as described or of poor quality even reported listings with all the evidence to support my report and Amazon do nothing.listings are still advertising the wrong items and sellers still allowed while buyers are made to jump through hoops to get their money back. don't believe the reviews either most are for totally different products as plonks who leave reviews don't look at what they are leaving reviews for and look to see if it is a verified purchase and go by that.

Miss Morris,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Do not deliver property to the property.They used to be so good. Some of the driver just leave it outside of a small block of flats any members of the public can pick up ot they just throw in side the door.

Against my better judgement I reordered an item that was lost by a carrier in the UK after the item had been shipped safely from the US to UK.EXACTLY the same thing has happened again this time with a different UK carrier who have promised delivery on 4 days running and failed to do so.Now Amazon.com want me to wait until 25th DECEMBER despite the fact that it should have been here by the 11th at the latest and I have been told that it is ""out for delivery"" on 4 days running (3rd, 4th , 5th and 6th)by EVRI who are probably the most useless delivery company on the planet.UPDATE:9th DecemberThe (non) delivery company, Evri,  have now categorically stated on 2 dates (8th and 9th Dec) that they WILL deliver my package - they have failed to do so. They are a deceitful, lying company and are unfit for purpose. I hope Amazon.com are proud of their partners total incompetence and lies.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON.COM AGAIN AS THEY HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY USELESS AND HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THIS."

Jahnae Alston,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They are getting worse and worse with the scams at this company! I returned 2 items to the merchant and both were marked as received! I got 3 different days claiming I would be refunded and all dates have passed ! The merchant is now claiming that an internal investigation has to be done in order to find out why the refund wasn‚Äôt processed by THEIR team. WTF DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME ??

Thales of Miletus,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I purchase a lot of gear off Amazon from electric bikes to screws. I always give an honest review of my purchases so others can gauge the quality. However I‚Äôve noticed lately that Amazon doesn‚Äôt  like negative reviews and I‚Äôve been emailed to say my review broke their community guidelines. I do not swear. I am not entirely scathing. I leave them some wriggle room. This has put me right off Amazon as I feel I cannot trust their reviews if people can‚Äôt tell the truth.

Paulette Metoyer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon driver of a blue electric delivery truck entered my driveway past a sign stating ""delivery trucks stop here"" which is in front of a small remote controlled gate.  The driver drove over the gate and when driving out carried it under his truck into the street.  He was seen doing this by my son in law.  He knocked over the bollards marking the edge of the drieway and drove off the driveway and probably hit a tree as I found pieces of his red rear lights along the side of my driveway.  I asked Amazon for $129 to purchase a new driveway gate from Amazon.  I first spoke to Samad Hussain, then to Divine G,  then got a letter from Deb Wentzel, each asking for the same info, which I submitted at least twice.  I then got an email stating that they were closing the case.  I called back and spoke to Brandon (in South Africa) who listened and said that I had 2 options:  I could accept $100 from Amazon with no further questions OR if I wanted more I would still have to submit more infor and more photos, which I could not do as the area has been cleaned up.  I told Brandon that I would accept the $100.  Then 2 hours later I got an email from Daniel stating that Amazon would not give me the $100 promised unless I send more photos.  BOTOM LINE:  AMAZON PROMISED ME $100 IN COMPENSATION FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE THEN SOMEONE ELSE (DANIEL) REVERSED IT ALL. "

Beli Sukumaran,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed with the Delivery ProcessI ordered an expensive item from Amazon expecting their usual prompt service, but this experience has been a disaster. First, it took an unusually long time to arrive. When the delivery finally came, the driver didn‚Äôt even bother ringing my doorbell‚Äîthey just left.When I contacted customer service, they informed me it would take another three days to redeliver, making it 10 days since I placed the order. This is completely unacceptable for a company of Amazon‚Äôs size and reputation. They‚Äôve proven to be inefficient and unreliable in delivering important purchases.I expect much better service, especially when paying a premium. Amazon seriously needs to step up its logistics game."

John PRINCE,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Poor delivery lead-times and appears priority shipping in China is going to local businesses competing with Amazon and selling the same sourced items.

Michelle Wilcox,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a reconditioned iPhone 1710/2024, ‚Ç¨ 349.00. When the iPhone arrived it was faulty. I returned the iPhone as instructed by Amazon via the carrier SEUR who collected the iPhone from my home on 28/10/24 and gave me a receipt document as proof. I have been waiting for a full refund since the 28/10/24, I have repeatedly been lied to by customer service at Amazon and  I cannot get to speak to anyone in a managerial position. Amazon are now fobbing me off by telling me that because SEUR did not scan the package at their end, it is showing in Amazon system as not received therefore Amazon and the 14 days returns policy has passed. therefore I will not be reimbursed.I have been a customer of Amazon prime for many years and have never been treated in the way that I have recently.  They fail at the lack of communication on a personal legal once a claim has been escalated, every correspondence is now done by automated responses Not being able to speak to anybody with any kind of authority I feel is disgusting and extremely poor customer service. It proves the profits Amazon make are NOT re-invested into the training of their customer service staff!!"

James Anderson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's fullfilment and delivery performance has gone straight down the toilet. I've had ongoing problems with items dissappearing in shipping, LONG shiping times (listings don't show origin), incorrect items delivered and deliveries being left on my porch late at night. I had quit using Amazon for a while but decided to give them another chance. My bad. It was a deja-vue experience with the same catagoy of item that never got delivered last year. What is really frustrating is that their website doesn't even have the option to select ""item not delivered"" as the reason for a refund. I had to hunt down a phone number and call to get the matter resolved. To rub salt in the wound, it is going to take 5 to 7 business days for them to refund the money to my Amazon Store Card.Another thing that now irks me about Amazon is that there are a lot of items that you can't purchase unless you subscribe to Amazon Prime. There is ZERO chance that I'm going to pay extra for poor service.I'm not alone in my frustration either. My sister is having the same problems with Amazon that I am. I need to find a replacement item for the one that didn't get delivered (again), but I won't even bother ordering from Amazon. I get MUCH better service from Ebay and their return/refund system is simple and they have better control over where the items ship from. I'd even pay more at a retail outlet since it's not a bargain if you don't get what you ordered. "

Jules 1888,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I'm frustrated at how Amazon has become a site for people selling fakes!Last year, my friend in a different part of the UK and I both had the same duck advent calendar from Amazon, his was gifted to him by someone else and as we both started opening the calendars it became clear that the items inside did not match the imagery on the listings! Many identical small yellow ducks that got tedious to find in the calendar.This year I was pleased to see a national lampoons calendar which I purchased and put away for Dec, the contents had been disappointing and today on day 5 there wasn't an item behind the door! I take the inside of the calendar out and it's all tiny bits of plastic tat! Not the national lampoons figures as shown on the image! I looked at reviews on all these listings for the calendar and it was the same story, people with very disappointed children left with calendars that don't feel worth opening now! People had to open them to try and find out why windows had nothing in them. What makes me laugh is you get fake reviews thrown into the mix! Ridiculously rave reviews showing a real calendar image that's supposed to be theirs and they post the reviews in September? Who started opening advent calendars in September?The seller came back surprisingly quick and agreed to a refund but I find that about Chinese rip offs, there's that many they get away with not refunding that it's still cost effective to sell fake tat and refund the few that do ask for one.I turned more to Amazon because eBay stopped being trustworthy because of the amount of really poor Chinese scams on there, you need to deal with this Amazon! If the seller didn't refund me, I would certainly expect Amazon to because their site shows fake images on listings!"

I've been deliberately ripped off! I have screen shots of three dates I was supposed to receive my refund for the Alaskan Jacket. I called customer service to day and the woman acted like she new hardly any English!  She didn't send a text or email to confirm my account Iike she said she was going to. Either an employee at Amazon Warehouse stole the jacket or someone who ordered a Chillsun air mattress will be getting a surprise! The gaslighting I have gone through is unbelievable. I was basically ripped of for $150! How can you get a refund for items with no bar code and no one bothers to open the box to see what is in it??  Where do I take this t! I called customer service immediately after I saw the error on my account (being given the wrong refund). I have screen shots for three dates I was to receive my refund for this jacket! Why am I being penalized for people not doing there jobs!! What the hell is wrong with people!!???

Steve Davey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon used to be extremely reliable but recently they have become a terrible company to deal with. If your items get ""lost"" , they refuse to send out replacements despite them still being in stock on the website. The customer service will outright lie to you in order to get you out of their hair and a favourable review. Delivery drivers show no concern as to the safety of packages and will leave them in wherever is convenient for them without even knocking. Their emails state they want to build the most customer-centric company on earth yet the pressure they put on drivers makes them do things like the above to meet targets. Months of mistakes, damaged packages and refusal to correct their errors or alter their practices have led me to cancel my membership and deal with companies who may take slightly longer but actually care about their customers. Sorry...Rant over"
Craig Crawford,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Used to be good, used to get really good value for the prime account.Now most of the stuff is cheap Chinese garbage / outright scams / goods that arrive damaged / dumped at the front step while the driver is already back in the van and driving away by the time the door is opened...And then contacting Amazon is a minefield, I couldn't figure it out but in the end I was able to return, but it caused me a great deal of anxiety.They're adding more blocks in front of contacting them..."
Lawrence,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There has been a dramatic decline in Amazon customer service.  One of the expensive Amazon thermostats I bought in the summer turns out now to be defective as soon as the weather turned cold.  At considerable expense I had an HVAC professional come out to check.  Everything working correctly, including the other thermostat.  The defective one is not activating the furnace. When I went to Amazon customer service a very high handed service rep told me I could not return it because it is too late.  When I objected that the problem had only now shown up, she literally hung up on me.  Simply shocking, with no redress for either the thermostat or the cost of having a professional verify that the unit is defective. And a new one is only available in five days."
James Trower,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Very poor AI customer service. I have been struggling for days now and I cannot speak to a real person. Hong Kong is not an option on the call back service.The AI CS is very poor and needs to be improved. All I need to find out is an order question. I need to update payment details, but when I do it, its not done and now my order after 5 days of trying has been auto cancelled. Merry Christmas! A simple problem that a human could have easily advised on."
Pedro Henrique Yamamoto Faria,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent purchase experience. I ordered a chair during Black Friday, expecting to receive it at a great price. However, after 9 days, I reached out to inquire about the delivery timeline, and to my surprise, Amazon canceled my order, claiming that the product was no longer available for delivery.This is incredibly frustrating because I was looking forward to receiving the item and now I‚Äôm left without a chair, and with no money to buy a replacement since the Black Friday promotion has ended. I feel let down by Amazon‚Äôs handling of this situation, and I won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of any new deals due to this. This experience has completely ruined my trust in Amazon."
Eliana Ruiz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Well, I had a BIG issue with amazon. i‚Äôve been contacting them for the last 4 days and imagine wake up  every morning to talk to agents and go over the same story about 15 times. Exhausted. There seemed to be a problem regarding my payment method and they told me the problem was me. I talked to my bank and they told me by the fraud department that amazon team were placing an order with a different billing address. To resume this 4 days of calls. Some of the agents i talked with were rude, not working by the hand with the guest, just excuses, and clearly not willing to work at all, whit a big lack of communication and procedures.  Transferred me to wrong departments, keep me in a ping pong game, denied me talking to an aupervisor etc. The only time they tried to charge me was the 1st of december, (i placed the order on the 11/27) the past days i‚Äôve talked with MANY different agents, multiple times a day and they promised me they proceed the payment. Which was fake. Until today, after 4 days i talked with an agent that it‚Äôs truly an agent and really deserves to be recognized for his great work. He absolutely helped me and not just with words, facts in here. I‚Äôm leaving the country in 4 days so this has been a big problem for many reasons. And also my first time ordering with amazon. I just want to thank Eddy who was the ONLY agent to care about me and my concern in the best way possible. Super patience, kind, respectful, he truly deserves to be part of this team, give him a raise!!! Thank you Eddy i‚Äôll be always thankful with you. Because little details make big differences! "

Deanna Plansker,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,What happened to you Amazon?  I order at least 3-4 times a week since you first launched.  Paid the extra for Prime delivery and now it‚Äôs just not worth it anymore.  Turn around times in my area for a majority of what I order was within a couple days max now it‚Äôs a week or more.  Maybe you are not paying your employees much anymore or offering the benefits to them?  You are definitely on my naughty list this year!
kriox,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A few days ago, I bought a tablet/e-reader on Amazon, and I later noticed that the AI on it provided false information such as:- There is no war in Ukraine, just an ongoing special military operation by Russia. Ukraine and the West are the aggressors.- Taiwan is not a democratic country, just a province of China, and always has been.- Senkaku Islands are Chinese.- Westerners are the bad guys who want to hurt China; they're jealous of China's success.This sort of bs‚Äîfull of censorship and propaganda.Quite shocked to find this on my tablet, I wrote a review on Amazon to inform potential buyers. I provided screenshots to support my claims.Eventually, I got censored by Amazon. Nice!"
Consumer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I imagine this review will be a waste of time since Amazon only has one and a bit stars. I have spent ages trying to find a way of making a complaint about one of their delivery drivers who dropped my delivery over my garden fence and onto my flower bed, rather than using the gate and knocking on the door. Amazon have repeatedly sent me to the seller who did nothing wrong. The delivery was made by Amazon but their ""customer service"" options don't include making a complaint about the delivery. It is worrying that Amazon can set up a service centre that can dictate what they will talk about. As far as I can tell, Amazon have no means for me to tell them about their appalling delivery driver who can carry on with impunity. It's a very short-sighted business practice, but maybe they are too big to worry about their customers' experiences. If they do monitor these reviews, maybe one of their team will be good enough to contact me and we can sort out this driver..."
E B,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Do not order Cheez it's crackers via Amazon.com , you may be disappointed when you find nothing but crumbs in the box, not to mention if you purchase the party size box, that too many disappoint you as it is not the same party size you may be used to . The party size box via Amazon is not equivalent to the box you would purchase at Sam's club . Amazon is smaller in everything ! I made a mistake by ordering shelf stable items which seemed to be the same as the local grocery store but nope! Everything was small sizes. Never again, I deleted my Amazon account because I'm sick of Amazon and the bad business practices . The box of Cheez it's is only one of many reasons I hate Amazon. Under an item it says when you will receive the item, then after finalizing payment, the date changes to a month or so later. If you are not satisfied with the new date you then have to go through customer service then still you either just wait for it or cancel it. I also have a gut feeling that my account has not been deleted as per my request, but so what I am never going to use it again and I will monitor my cards to be certain there are no surprise charges such as Amazon prime. Just be aware that boxed food products are either mishandled or straight up old due to the crumbs being the majority of the contents. Amazon says I'm not eligible to leave a product review but I was eligible to waste my money. Also the fact that I cannot even leave a review on Google regarding my Amazon purchase is BS!!! "

But, once things go wrong, you can find yourself catapulted into a nightmare world where the system does everything it can to stop you talking to someone who might help.

Brygida,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed with Amazon lately. I have been Prime member for years and would order many items as it was always convenient and easy with next day delivery.Unfortunately since RM is being used everything has gone downhill. The tracking is awful and details never updated. Prime deliveries take 3-5 days! This is shocking and definitely puts me off buying from Amazon. If I have to wait this long for a product why bother ordering from Amazon,I may aswell buy elsewhere. RM is the least reliable delivery company in the UK and to see Amazon using them is a BAD decision for their business. I've recently ordered something on Amazon through Prime as I thought it would come the next day, then I've noticed the delivery changed to be expected 3 days later. The tracking number provided said that RM is expecting the parcel, but Amazon status said it has been despatched. On the day of expected delivery Amazon update showed expected by 8pm BUT RM still had no update on the tracking page and it still claimed ""awaiting parcel"" so this got me worried and I knew something isn't right. Finally, 8pm has passed and no parcel arrived, Amazon status change to ""now expected 3 days layer"" which means this would make nearly 7 days for delivery. I've contacted RM the next say and been told the seller still hasn't shipped the item so they are awaiting it. I have contacted Amazon and requested to cancel the order and contacted the seller to request stop and not dispatch the product anymore as I went elsewhere. No response from the seller but I thought I've done my part. Amazon said they have stopped the order. The next day, the parcel was delivered to my neighbour!! Otherwise I wouldn't accept it! Contacting Amazon / seller again to explain I don't want it anymore and I need to return. They send me a return label which I had to pay for!!! Contacted them to say I am not playing for this return. Finally got the pre-paid return label. Now I can't see any more updates on RM as to where the parcel is and if it has been delivered! I can only see it has been accepted by RM when I dropped it off, few days later (4) still no update so I am now worried about my refund ¬£799!!! Refund is not done automatically now with Amazon! You have to go to the item you've returned and request a refund which then takes up to 7 days! I am so disappointed Amazon is no longer the same, it's a real shame!"

Don't use kdp,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing to formally complain about the unjust termination of my Amazon KDP account and the subsequent theft of my royalties, which were wrongfully withheld under false accusations of misleading content. As a dedicated writer who adhered to all guidelines, I have come to learn that this issue is systemic, affecting many authors on the platform who find themselves in the same situation. Amazon has a responsibility to ensure a fair and thorough review process before penalizing its contributors, as these baseless accusations have devastating financial and creative impacts on writers like myself who rely on your platform for a living. It is crucial for Amazon to address these recurring grievances and implement safeguards to prevent further injustices."

Now my membership is in pause and I can‚Äôt use prime whatsoever until they figure this out, it just keeps telling me to renew my subscription when they too 228.00 already.

Nate Nute,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôm sharing my story to warn others: Amazon is not as reliable as you think, and when they fail, there is NO accountability. My ¬£400 order, requiring a signature upon delivery, was marked as ‚Äúhanded to the resident,‚Äù but this is a blatant lie. I was home all day, waiting eagerly for what should have been a wonderful Christmas surprise for my kids, but it never arrived.There was no photo evidence of the delivery. No one rang the doorbell, no contact was made, and no attempt to reach me by phone. To make matters worse, my building requires permission for access, meaning someone must have let the driver in. Yet Amazon refuses to explain who supposedly ‚Äúsigned‚Äù for the package or take responsibility for this disaster.I‚Äôm a healthcare professional who worked tirelessly to save for these gifts, and now my children‚Äôs Christmas is ruined. Instead of joy, we are left with frustration, anger, and heartbreak. Amazon‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing we can do.‚Äù No investigation. No answers. Just a brick wall of indifference.This isn‚Äôt just about my experience. It‚Äôs about a pattern of behavior that‚Äôs both unethical and borderline illegal. How many others have had packages marked as ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù when they weren‚Äôt? How many families have been robbed of their hard-earned money and left powerless against a corporation that refuses to listen?Amazon‚Äôs practices hurt both customers and small businesses. Their delivery system is broken, and their refusal to take accountability leaves us with no recourse. No one can trust that their order will actually arrive, and there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll ever see your money or items again.I‚Äôm asking everyone who sees this to take action. Share this story. Post your own experiences. Warn your family, friends, and colleagues. Together, we can shine a light on these practices and demand better from Amazon.This was supposed to be a season of joy for my children and me. Instead, Amazon turned it into a nightmare.

I don't even know why they blocked my account. I was only buying eBooks for kindle. I got the money from mygiftcardsupply gift cards. All is legit as far as payment goes.Another suspicion is maybe the block has something to do with the fact I'm Russian... and who cares that I'm pro-peace and obviously don't support a lot of what my gov does lately. Amazon blocks you giving you no benefit of a doubt. They're no better, and essentially stole my $100. Basically, be careful with Amazon if you're purchasing something with gift card balance (or if you're from a country US gov doesn't like). Maybe you should spend that balance as fast as possible in case Amazon decides to ban you for nothing."

John Brigg,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is completely cactus. On 5 October I placed two separate orders for different digital audio players and extension memory cards. All these items are now listed as ""Your package may be lost"".On 9 November I ordered a DAP and memory card as replacements for two of the items lost above. These are now also listed as ""Your package may be lost"". So 6 items in 3 separate parcels have all got lost. I have never had such useless service from anybody on the internet. Message: Never try to buy anything from Amazon. "
LV,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Everything I order from Amazon is great! I read the reviews and if it's clothing, I read what the material is made of to figure out if it's worth it or not.The simple fact  being a prime member and that it arrives in 2 days or less is fabulous! It allows me time to try it and if I'm not satisfied I send it back for free at any UPS stand alone store."

Paul Naley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Placed two order for the Dyson Part No. 970013-02 filter, one for myself and one for my son using two separate orders. Amazon charged me $37.99 for each filter. A few days after I placed these orders I checked the Dyson website and found that the Dyson retail pricing for this filter is $29.99. Today I contacted Amazon customer support, but they refused to refund me the overcharge. Just stating that they do not price match. This is not price matching, but it is price gouging. Amazon is charging significantly more than the advertised retail price for this filter. Dyson is also offering free shipping for this filter."

Mr Hunt,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"No Problems to Date. Never had a problem yet and used many times. Perhaps some just 'moan' for the sake of it or try to get 'something for Nothing' deals. This December Amazon ships out some deliveries, in our case to Royal Mail who have also been very good. Beats trailing round the shops during festive periods, although some people just like going out for the 'hell' of it."
June Richard,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I placed an order then contacted Amazon customer service to ask how to hide the order containing family gifts from other family members sharing the Amazon account.  I could hardly understand the customer service person to begin with and felt bad asking them to repeat what they said 3 times - only to be told there is no option to hide the order!  The only thing you can do is archive the order once shipped!  This means the order is viewable for several days based on delivery dates for items.The customer service person was unsympathetic and not helpful - but I understand she couldn‚Äôt help.Amazon needs to fix this much needed feature - like you can hide something on Amazon Prime video.  
Sean Lynch,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought a product that weighs over 6 kg. Received an empty box that weighed 2 kg according to Bring (the transport company). Obviously someone at Amazon stole it and they do nothing about it.I had to call several times to get it solved, as they promised to call back and never did.Another problem arose at the same time as I was not receiving SMSs for dual-authentication. They admitted it was a problem but could do nothing about it.Also, to contact support you need to log in, so this was a catch 22. I had to do a lot of searching on google to find out how to get around it, rather than them just putting the contact information in the error message or on the home page. For a 'customer centric' company they seem to do their utmost to plague their customers."

Lukas St,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Pitty I can't put minus star. The service of amazon is somewhat disappointing.  I've purchased items on 11th November and still waiting 3 more weeks to receive it. They message me about the parcel to be delayed again and again. They are pushing people to get membership.  Not worth if you order 2 to 3 times a yeah. Other big retailers are much faster even up to a week. Very disappointed.  Will try to order elsewhere in future 
Harold Pinter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If amazon tells you that a parcel has been delivered, don't trust them.  Here's my experience.  Found a suitable guitar case on amazon, ordered it for delivery on 12/1. Checked at 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm to find delivery update.  Statement said parcel was out for delivery.  Around 5 pm, amazon's form stated that the parcel was delivered at 11:39.  Amazon's verbiage stated: ""Delivered today.  Your package was left near the front door or near porch"" However, never received email from Amazon.  Now dark, four adults searched for the package.  Nowhere to be found. Called amazon customer service, who stated that even though items may be reported as being delivered, was informed that they think they have the right to deliver 24-48 hours later than we have been told it's ""already been delivered"". Finding all this out too late, I have no means to protect the guitar. Amazon jeopardized my situation, refused to compensate me.  This is deception, lying, and fraud.

However it‚Äôs long enough that I can‚Äôt see the package if it‚Äôs thrown over the gate on the grass and in the dark I can‚Äôt see the package even if it‚Äôs on the drive . As no one rings the bell it‚Äôs only after I have logged into my account I can see it‚Äôs delivered . Even more annoyingly it states parcel was handed to resident.

Amir H,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer for 20 years, but my recent experiences with their customer service have been so poor that I may never use them again. Recently I made a purchase that somehow submitted before I was able to enter a promo code. I tried to ask customer service to apply the code, but the rep said it would be best to cancel and resubmit the order. He went ahead and cancelled it, but my items went up in price when I tried to purchase moments later. The promo code also gave an error. I went to customer service again and this is what I was told: ""In this case I would request you to please place this order. Once the order is delivered to you, please contact us back and we will help you with the price difference. I will add notes to your accountSo that you do not have to explain everything again. That promotional code promo will also be refunded. Whole price difference will be refunded.""Sure enough, when I contacted them after delivery, they said that they don't issue refunds. When I asked them to explain the instruction I had been given, I was passed around endlessly from one agent to another, some of them would just disconnect. Finaly I called by phone and reached a helpful man who agreed to a partial refund.  He transferred me to a department to complete the process, but then I got an agent who took me back to square 1 and said I was not entitled to a refund. When I explained that everything had been discussed & agreed, she hung up on me.  Apparently hanging up/disconnecting on customers is now their standard practice.  They also have such misleading deals - e.g. I was comparison shopping for a tablet and had saved one to my cart, but there was a countdown timer showing I had 2 minutes to purchase before the end of the Prime Days discount. I made the purchase, but in fact the price was exactly the same afterwards.I would just urge everyone to avoid Amazon going forward.  "
Philip Moore,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon misleading its customers to save money. Not willing to orders on time if you‚Äôre not a prime Just about profits and knowing what else are you going to do? Order from somewhere else, nope. Hell even if you tried it's likely it's still going through Amazon and they're making a profit. But this is just the beginning of mega corporate deciding that they can do whatever they want. Anything you order if you‚Äôre not a prime member they delay for nothing, we don‚Äôt know why public not understanding, why government not involves in this type of discrimination, why someone want to take membership to order something from a store, they make billions by subscribing and actually they spend less than half of the amount for shipping expenses."

Ivo Ivanov,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has become a big joke! Ebay used to be bad, but recently, Amazon has become much worse. A few times, my next-day delivery was not at all the next-day delivery. I expect from Amazon if it has been paid for the next delivery I expect next-day delivery! Unfortunately, paying for Prime does not really count as having any benefits for paying Prime. I ordered a part which I was waiting the whole day, as I wanted it on this specific day because I had to travel and I wanted the part fixed on the car. Even though the driver was from 1mp in the next street where I live and he should have delivered the part at 3 pm but he did not! I can see the van on the phone from the GPS ...I even took my bike and went to find him, as I saw the Amazon Van, I stopped and asked him if could get the parcel, with proof in my phone in my hand. He lied to me as he said he was not the driver of the parcel, there were other drivers. I've spoken with Amazon customer service and they said the driver had their own route and they are not obliged to follow the map route from Amazon. I am disappointed as Amazon lost the respect to its customers! I'm thinking of cancelling Amazon Prime as it looks like it is not working anymore. "

Mrs Lonergan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could give the -0 stars I would. I ordered an iPad On Sunday 24th November expecting the item to come by Tuesday 26th November.

They are saying I have to wait until 10th December to get a refund but when I ask them if they will issue me a refund on ¬£289 on that day they won't answer me and keep saying they will investigate it. Citizens Advice have said they are in breach of their contract and should be refunding me my money. They should suspend the delivery driver until the item is found. Why can't we speak to someone in the UK? This will be taken to small courts as Jeff Bezon has failed to acknowledge my 2 emails I have sent him. The Customer Service team are disgraceful. Amazon I really hope you go bump.

Christine Ward,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I have an order that was supposed to be delivered on 11/30 but it never showed up.  Now they are saying it won't be here until 12/2.  My boyfriend has one that now says won't be here until 12/6. How can it go from being delivered to waiting 2-5 days longer. Seems Amazon can't keep up with deliveries. We both pay for prime so we get deliveries early but that doesnt seem to be the case anymore.  Doesn't seem worth paying the annual fee when it is still taking a week for deliveries. This seems to be happening alot lately.  They no longer say next day delivery on anything.

Alex Litvenenko,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I placed an order for 18+ items on 11/1. The order exceeded what was in my account by a small amount whic i paid by cc. 10 items were delivered in the first 2 weeks of Nov. By the 22nd, i could no longer wait for the food in the outstanding items to be shipped and cancelled those after getting food elsewhere. There was one outstanding otc supplement i csnnot buy anywhere near me plus a craft item and 4 gkids gifts left still to be delivered. After numerous chat and phone conversations, the amazon rep admitted that the problem was with amazon and not me or my payment methods. He stated to just relax, i didn't have to do anything and Amazon would see to it I'd get my order on Monday 12/2. Meanwhile, Amazon is placing all kinds of messages on my account that my payment- for all 18 items mind you- needs to be revised because the entire payment was declined. So, i went into the customer service chat for the 7th time in one month and asked Omar to look at the issue because if i was supposed to be receiving the remaining items in this HUGE order from the 1st of the month per my phone convo, then why were they continuing to try to charge me again for the entire 18 items. The SA ""customer service"" Omar then took it upon himself to cancel my entire order after waiting one month for it, containing the otc supplement I needed 30 days ago and refunded my balance INSUFFICIENTLY. I called ""customer service"" and spoke to a ""supervisor"" who desperately wanted to re-write the narrative on the entire scenario, and who ended up telling me the situation was beyond their control. She INSTRUCTED me without apology, to recall what I had outstanding in the $294+ order, search for those items (one of which was now double in price) and put them in the shopping cart. She stated to me she was giving me $50 in Amazon credit so that I could get my items using that plus the account refund from the Omar cancelled order. Omar not only cancelled my order, he ERASED my order and all accompanying emails stating that I paid for it. Upon trying to check out with the cart now with items that I could only recall from memory because all traces of the order had vanished, courtesy of Omar, it was evident that the items now grossly exceeded the amount of the refund for what appears to a fictitious vanishing order. The ""supervisor"" informed me that the credit she was providing me could not be used for the long over due otc medicine nor anything else in the order because the credit she gave me could only be used for items sold by Amazon, none of which were the items i was expecting on monday nor anything I needed. ""Supervisor"" basically told me that I was out of luck and that's all Amazon was going to do to rectify the situation. Attempting to retreive any information on the now vanished order, i found that amazon attempted to not only charge me once for the $5.83 that they said they couldn't find a record for, but they've tried to charge me the $5.83 nearly EVERYDAY since 11/2 for it repeatedly. In fact, my cc co paid them, then they took it out of my account balance until there was no more money in either. I am obviously FURIOUS and would like to warn others that Amazon customer service agents are able to cancel your orders and steal your emails AT WILL and according to their supervisors, Amazon admits to being POWERLESS to stop it?"
Jennifer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have enjoyed using amazon for a long time now however they have started using unreliable companies for their deliveries.  We now often do not get our orders and amazon will not allow us to request a refund because these delivery companies claim they can not find our address or they attempt a delivery stating no one is home when our cameras show them never arriving.  Amazon better figure this out soon.

Chad Eskins,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So I order two solar panels but only one is delivered. After five days of waiting the other one never comes so I contact Amazon and UPS. Amazon tells me I need to go to the police station and file a report!! What? Since when? So I say fine I'll go to popo. While at the police station the officer is rather confused as to who the suspect of theft would be. Should they investigate UPS? Amazon perhaps? A call into Amazon yields a rude cs rep who refuses to identify herself by name or id number to a police officer. The officer says it'll take at least a week perhaps longer to get the report, although he's not even sure how to write it up. He calls his supervisor and neither have ever in their careers ever heard of writing a police report for this type of situation. When I contact UPS they state I do not need a police report, however Amazon needs to initiate the dispute with them, I cannot do it. Amazon claims I need to get a police report for stolen goods in order for them to investigate it....Why an I left running around and waiting weeks on end for something the carrier messed up? It feels like Amazon is saying I took the solar panel!! No more Amazon for me this is horrible experience!

Sharon Smout,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My partner ordered a bedspread from amazon.the seller was home republic The item was no good so the seller sent us a qr code .the code wouldn't work so the seller sent us another one.this was OK so parcel was sent off .apparently parcel ended up in the wrong place .the seller won't refund the money and amazon can't do anything about it .I'm disgusted in both companies especially amazon who should not be advertising for dodgy companies.

Jennifer Jacobsen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to love ‚ù§Ô∏è Amazon... I'm currently a prime member lol (I won't renew)... but I'm not sure what's happening... in the last two months I've had 3 issues with orders (two having to do with orders not arriving and customer service being of little help). I found out when I called Amazon about an order that did not arrive, that they can't make their seller take down an item that is not available even if it means customers will pay for it, but it will never arrive (regardless of what shipping/tracking information says - I'm still waitiung for orders, and an order from 2021 still hasn't arrive - its 2024 - even though it says shipped from an Amazon service center... but Amazon hasn't refunded it... they've ""escalated"" it)... I guess it's back to regular in store shopping... at least then I know if I tell my son I bought him a Christmas present üéÅ... I can actually put it under the tree. I'm too tired to go through the 3 orders in 2 months the messed up... Its a shame Amazon... your making indoor/foot hoofing it shopping look good."

Joe Mackenzie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My girlfriend had two parcels meant to delivered to her office in central London which were marked as delivered but never came. It has a full time receptionist and CCTV so we are sure it didn't come. She reported these to the support team but they said the items must have been stolen by a third party and told us to raise a police report. It is clear this is not the case as it is clear they were never delivered. They also said we would have to forego the black Friday discount we got on these if they resent which is just appalling given the fault is Amazon's. We want to know why we need to file a police report when it is clear that a third party did not steal the items. And why the discount would not be applied for a Prime customer who has not received the items through no fault of her own. Highly likely to discontinue prime and boycott Amazon if this cannot be sorted out properly. Shockingly bad customer service.

Mike Whitehouse,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I should NOT have had to contact Amazon in the first place. It took 17 minutes to sort out a refund for products that were marked as 'undeliverable' on my orders. A refund should be automatic. Another problem is that with 2 items in the order I could not get a refund on either automatically because one was a medicine. Unacceptable that I was put through the AI mill. Customer service rep. was great- but I should not have needed him.

Mike,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I've been AMZN customer for > 15 years.  I recently downloaded my purchase history:  > 5,000 lines.The past few years AMZN has gone downhill, such as:-- receiving wrong merchandise;-- deliveries not following directions, & several times items left out in rain;-- Very annoying to try to login, but must respond / solve a puzzle, to proceed to account.    a.  Every time that occurs, I just go to another online retailer, where the merchant is pleased to welcome me, rather than present obstacles.Another irritation, which is either just carelessness, or attempt at fraud:--On the same page of a search, some items will be listed for instance as ""cost per item,: or ""cost per ounce.""   And even when all are cost per item -- such as with vitamin supplements -- the price is often cost per serving, but some products have serving of 1 vitamin, while others require 2 for the same total quantity.    Thus, no way to compare prices, per AMZN descriptions."
Emil,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have never experienced such poor customer service from a company as I have with Amazon. I have three separate cases involving missing refunds, amounting to over $286 USD in total.1. Missing refund for a liver detox kit ordered in September: The item was damaged during transport and never delivered. I contacted customer service multiple times (on October 5 and October 28) to request a refund. I followed all their instructions, including filling out a return form, but my refund was denied because ‚Äúmore than 60 days had passed.‚Äù This delay was entirely due to their own processes, not my actions.2. A second liver detox kit ordered in November was returned without my consent: I was informed that I would receive a refund no later than November 22, but this has not happened. I still do not know why the item was returned, or what went wrong.3. Monoatomic Gold order from November: This order was also returned without my approval, and I was falsely informed that I had canceled the order. The promised refund, due by November 22, has not been issued.I have contacted Amazon‚Äôs customer service five times, and each time I was met with robotic, dismissive responses. On November 26, I called again to express my frustration and asked to speak with a supervisor. My request was denied, and the call was abruptly terminated.Amazon has shown a complete lack of respect for its customers, their time, and their money. They blame internal processes, but this should not be the customer‚Äôs problem. At the very least, I expect them to fulfill their promises and take responsibility.I strongly advise against shopping with Amazon if you want to avoid similar poor treatment."

Colorful Emotion,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a customer of Amazon prime.de for many years, before Amazon.nl was even a thing. Around 2021 amazon.nl came on the market and amazon tried to get me on a .NL account and cancel my .DE account. I never done this so until to this day I have been Benefitting my amazon.de Prime benefits. Until yesterday!.. I bought an amazon.nl article that prompted me to try prime NL for free.. So I was like, okay I agree with this and I will cancel it because I already have my .DE account and I enjoy those benefits, amazon.de has more products of my liking. So I clicked the button, got and confirmation email.. and the next day my amazon.de prime got automatically cancelled.I did not agree to this! Customer service is trying to gaslight me into saying this was my choice. It did not say anywhere I would end my German subscription! We had a Legal Binding Agreement. Now they are also telling me they  cannot reinstate my old German prime subscript, so  redo what the system automatically without consent did.. Due to the fact this prime service I had doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Let me be clear, I did not consent to the cancellation of my account. I wish to have it reinstate. I know you guys have internal policies, but this is not the way I want to be treated. Please help me to reinstate my old amazon.de Prime, I don‚Äôt want the crappy new Dutch one. The Dutch amazon has less products I want. Amazon broke my legal agreement and I will take legal action when necessary, I‚Äôm ensured for it and got all the time in the world for crap like this"

Heidi Jane White,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bunch of thieves. 9 days before my Prime subscription was due for automatic renewal, they emailed me stating that they could not take payment and so my account was on hold. I messaged them through their online service, telling them what had happened. The complete idiot I wrote to told me this was the norm and did nothing. Surely they cannot even try to take what is not due?I cancelled everything, and will not ever use Amazon again. As far as I'm concerned they are dishonest thieving b####ds and I will not spend a penny more with them. I used to spend hundreds a month with them, so it's their loss. It's not the only problem with Amazon, though. They say you get free shipping with Prime, but their products are more expensive than most online retailers. You never know when, or if, your goods will arrive, and woe betide you want to leave a negative review about a product - this will be blocked by Amazon. So we have to come to the conclusion that all of the reviews are fake. Prime tv is absolute shite, filled with so many bad films that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. The only thing I will miss is Paramount tv, which I think should be separate from Amazon anyway. This company is an absolute disgrace."

David Firth,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is fantastic! In a lot of ways, the only downside is the delivery technique. It's fantastic that you can order something and get it the next day. If something pops in your mind, you can just order it on the app and know it's going to be with you the next day unless the delivery driver leaves it in full site on your doorstep for the local heroin addicts to steal. Amazon is one of the most convenient services ever created, but the delivery techniques used by the drivers could be better."

They didn't even ship the items in complete week, so I did a racing order from Aliexpress for cheaper.

Joanna Konyeh,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Zero star would have been ideal if that was possible. Ordered a dishwasher, delivery scheduled for 7AM - 7PM. No one turned up, no phone call, email or text. When I tried to track shipment, I got a notification to contact Amazon customer service to reschedule delivery. The team were terribly unhelpful and were quick to offer me compensation of a gift voucher worth ¬£20. I turned it down insisting I would prefer to have the dishwasher delivered instead than the voucher. They said it would take another 48hrs and they couldn't confirm a specific day/time. I asked for the order to be cancelled and money refunded. I was again told this was not possible as the item had been shipped even though still with their logistic company who couldn't provide a delivery schedule. Asked for the call to be escalated to a manager, spoke with manager who wasn't able to offer any further assistance but managed to process a refund which will take 48hrs which means I cant order my dishwasher until I get the money back in my account. Highly disappointed with Amazon - very very poor service."

Crystal Swan,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"You would think that a major brand like Amazon and Amazon Prime would have more Black Friday Deals and more competitive prices. The movies and shows on amazon prime aren't very good if good at all.

So I feel like unless they do better I'm going to be cancelling Amazon Prime after the holidays."

After 48 hours and still no parcel I logged it again as missing and was told that it must have been stolen so I should go and get a crime reference....no joke. The thing is it was never in my possession so it was not stolen from me, so why do I need to go and get a crime reference to be able to receive what I paid for. Raised a charge back with my bank so in all likelihood I will get the money back. But I will honestly never ever use Amazon again. "
Gemma,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have always been happy with Amazon (aside from the fact returns could be a smoother process in Ireland) until today. I had two accounts, UK and US, but they were not linked as prime membership, order history, etc. didn‚Äôt show on US account and emails received are from different email addresses with different registered companies shown. As I could not connect prime to my US account I decided to cancel it. However, this also cancelled my UK account despite them being separate and correspondence received in relation to cancelling the US account not mentioning cancelling my UK account. I now can‚Äôt access my ring doorbell, prime tv or amazon for UK and have lost money as I have paid in advance for subscriptions. I called within 15 minutes of account access being removed and was on the phone for 1 hour and 7 minutes having consistently being put on hold and was told there is nothing that can be done. At no point was I offered a call back when the issue had been looked into and the agent insisted I stay on the call while she typed up notes even though my call was not going to be further transferred and I explained that I was abroad so the call would be expensive. I assume that was so another call didn‚Äôt drop in but poor customer service. It was mentioned on the call that the agent could see my account yet it can‚Äôt be reinstated - I just don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm really unhappy with the lack of clarity in relation to closure of the account and can‚Äôt see how it is compliant under GDPR. There is no way my data was permanently deleted so quickly and I don‚Äôt know why it can‚Äôt be reinstated considering I didn‚Äôt consent to erasure of my UK account and requested it be reinstated.

Have read amazon suggested fixes like many others . Cannot find anyone where these suggested fixes have solved the issue. I have done all the fixes suggested and makes no difference. Did a factory reset which fixed issue for just a few minutes then the same. Also big problem how incredibly difficult it is to access somebody at Amazon to get help. So Amazon you get a lowest of the low rating for the reasons mentioned. So at the moment I have an Amazon firestick but cannot access any prime video. No problem to access Netflix, Apple, Disney and many many others and also Prime Video on other devices using same internet connection. BUT have Amazon Firestick but cannot access Amazon Video and the problem has been going on for several years and yet Amazon do not seem to have a fix as there is nothing published and there are no other customers where the problem has been resolved. So don't buy a firestick or if you have one hope that you do not get this issue  as you will get no help from amazon to fix it."

I finally found a way to request a phone call from a rep. It took here over 5 minutes while I waited on  hold to get my money refunded.

Robert Passman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered an HP Spectre x360 from Amazon on 10/21/24 which had specific options I wanted - cost $1,879. Arrived 2 days later as promised. Boxes were sealed and not opened. 20 minutes after starting setup - Win 11 blue screen of death appeared and announced a re-boot needed. Two seconds later shut down and rebooted. This continued multiple times even during an update ""Do Not Turn Off This Computer on monitor. Frequent random shut downs made the computer unusable. Onboard diagnostics showed a battery issue. Amazon authorized a return to Ivy Bridge Store, the third party seller. I indicated my intent to purchase another when the refund was issued. Not normal but understandable problem. Cost to ship - $89.63. Total cost - $1,968.63. Even though the brand new computer didn't work, had to pay shipping. Refund was $,1,729.68. one insult was an indication of a shipping refund of $1. Ivy Bridge/Amazon also kept $150.32 for a restocking fee. So, they restocked a computer that didn't work? We have no computer and are out $238.95 for a product that never worked. I spoke to Amazon customer service on the phone and was told by a person there they would look into it. Well, no news. I did order a replacement, directly from HP. Will take longer but it also includes a 2 year warranty.Amazon has changed. 8 years ago I ordered the wrong computer case and wanted to return it fully understanding there would be a restocking fee - my fault, case was fine. The re-seller balked telling me how expensive it would be for me. I told Amazon he didn't want to accept it with the fee. A couple of hours later it was resolved. Not today. Amazon allowed us to lose $238 for nothing."
Christine,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Disappointing and UnreliableI had high hopes for this app/website, but it falls short in so many ways. The interface is clunky and hard to navigate, and it crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to use. On top of that, some features advertised simply don‚Äôt work, and customer support is non-responsive. This app/website has potential, but it desperately needs major updates and better user experience design. Until then, I can‚Äôt recommend it. I am deeply disappointed. They tell you they can overnight a order most times it's two days. I was being a nice guy and letting them deliver every thing at once. My reward is a delivery at 9:00, 9:30 at night. Several times my packages have been delivered to the wrong door. When I inquired about it they asked did I check with my neighbors ? When did it get my responsibility to track down my package. Then I have to figure out by the photo were it was delivered. There is a big spotlight on my house number and we still can't get it right ! What a ripe off. Then they will blame it on the holiday and how busy they are. It was like that before the holidays! Please explain why amazon says my new card number is invalid, even when it scans it. Now I will not be able to keep my account because it will not accept my card that literally works everywhere else!!! I have used it on subscriptions tonight!!!! And all they say is. it's the banks fault. Delivery tracker says handed to me, found my package (paperback books) on my doorstep during a heavy storm. Was working from home all day, didn't miss anyone knocking, note on my door says if I can't answer there's a shed for packages. Couldn't find an option on amazon outside of reviewing the product."
Robin Bourne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's policies are clear for you to see on our website, Robin. This is what the help page I shared says about this: if an item is out of stock, you may not get it in two business days. Faster shipping reduces transit time but doesn't impact the order preparation time. Shipping time starts when the item ships.As such, items that are readily available to be shipped will arrive two business days later"
Peter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have prime membership with Amazon and prior to this experience I have never had any problems. However, my last order has been a complete farce.I ordered two products on 23rd November, one was due to arrive next day, the other the following day.On 24th November Amazon advised the order had been delayed and would now arrive on the 25th, if it didn't arrive the email advised I could claim a refund.On 25th November I received an email from Amazon stating the driver tried to deliver but the address was incomplete or incorrect. Total and utter nonsense as the correct delivery address was on the confirmation order so I phoned customer service who were very apologetic and that I would be refunded but needed to be transferred to another person. I was then cut off! I rang back and was then told I could not be refunded until the next day so call back.So, I called back next day and was told I had to fill in an incident report which I immediately sent.In the meantime I discovered Amazon had invoiced me over ¬£400 for both products nether if which had been delivered!!!I rang back and was then told I had to wait until 7th December before I could raise any claim so I asked to speak to a Supervisor. Unbelievably he advised I had to wait until 27th November before I had to claim and that an incident report wasn't required! When I repeatedly asked him why Amazon had invoiced me for goods which had not been delivered he continually tried to talk over me and then abruptly put the phone down on me!!!! Disgraceful customer service in every way from start to finish and who knows what garbage I will be told when I ring again chasing my money back!!!"
Joanna,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This was the worst conversation I‚Äôve ever had. The manager (Atifa) kept copying and pasting the phrase, ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" without providing an appropriate solution. There was zero empathy, no soft skills displayed, and to make matters worse, the chat was simply closed at the end. Absolutely unprofessional!Additionally, Amazon is acting against the law, as the courier left an expensive package at my door without any such instructions being given, which is legally prohibited. Now you expect me to resolve the situation by going to the police and wasting my time to fix the courier‚Äôs mistake."

Howard Fleming,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Black Friday with Amazon is just a con plain and simple if you get a bargain they don‚Äôt bother delivering it then offer you a refund after the delivery date thinking you will buy the same again at a higher price and thats with prime delivery every year they try it on. thankfully just received my order eventually a few days later I did have to phone amazon though to refuse a refund and demand the  order.

Packaging completely soaked, items wet through.Now trying yet again to negotiate the Amazon bot to get to speak to a human who will be very nice but totally unable to help; if I'm lucky I will get a refund but no replacements. What is the point of registering a safe place, if it is ignored? Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company ... totally untrue! "
John Boothroyd,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon used to be good at customer service but today's experience and checking reviews on trustpilot say otherwise now.Had to deal with five agents for a simple matter.Seems when one agent can't understand or can't/won't help ... just hands over to another ... and usually have to start all over again

Ashley Holland,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Recieved numerous packages from Amazon today and all of them were just discarded at my frontdoor in the rain. I work from home and was in all day, I heard no knock at the door or doorbell. Additionally, I recieved other deliveries proving my doorbell was working.The boxes were also damaged. Every box had been opened, in what looked like an effort to check what was within the packaging.The most frustrating thing about all of it, is Amazons automated online service and AI help assistant, doesn't accomidate for a poor delivery service, so you are unable to complain.It was only last month when I brought an expensive gaming monitor that Amazon's system said was delivered to the owner. Again I was in all day, but this time it wasn't even delivered. I had to declare the item as being undelivered and reorder. The second time it was delivered and I had to supply a code to the driver, a much preferable method.Overall bad customer service and really poor customer assitance."
Obbz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, but my recent experience has been so appalling that I feel compelled to leave this review. Amazon has taken my money for an order placed yesterday, but the item has not been dispatched, and the order status is a complete mess. It alternates between ""arriving today,"" ""problem occurred,"" and ""delivery failed, returning to sender,"" with no clear explanation provided.Unhelpful and Rude Customer Service:I‚Äôve spoken with four different chat agents today, including a manager and a supervisor, as well as one telephone agent. Every single interaction has been frustrating:Not one agent could explain why the order failed or why an item showing as in stock and available for next-day delivery cannot be delivered.When I ask for clarification or request further help, I‚Äôm abruptly disconnected from the chat without warning.Fake Complaint Emails:To make matters worse, every agent I‚Äôve spoken to has given me a fake or invalid complaints email address, further delaying my ability to escalate the issue. This is not just unprofessional‚Äîit feels intentionally obstructive.Holding My Money with No Resolution:I‚Äôve been told a refund was issued, but my account shows no record of it. Meanwhile, Amazon has emailed me to say they cannot cancel the order, even though it hasn‚Äôt been dispatched. This leaves me with no choice but to contact my bank to request a chargeback. Amazon has effectively stolen my money, as I‚Äôve paid for an item I‚Äôm not receiving, and no one has taken responsibility for resolving the issue.What Happened to Amazon‚Äôs Service?In the past, Amazon‚Äôs customer service was helpful and reliable, but today, it has been nothing short of abysmal. The agents have been rude, dismissive, and entirely unwilling to help. As a Prime member, I expected better, especially since I specifically selected next-day delivery, which was not honored.Final Thoughts:This experience has left me deeply disappointed and questioning whether I want to continue using Amazon at all. I have lost money, time, and trust in what used to be a dependable service.If Amazon is unwilling to provide resolutions or proper support, then it‚Äôs time they stop advertising customer service as one of their strong points.Avoid if you value your time, money, or sanity."
Marie Schulze,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I bought a bottle of magnesium and the seal that goes around the cap was missing. I had to take pictures showing the seal was missing and then they said it looks like the picture and no refund. This company and their customer service has really went down. I spent thousands of dollars with then and when you order can goods I have received wrong items dented cans and even cans the look like the were stabbed with something sharp. I give honest feedback they delete it every time. I hope with things changing that this business closes because they don‚Äôt stand behind their products and they hide the consumer reviews. 
Steven Libardi,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Misleading Delivery Promises and Poor Customer Service !!! I have been an Amazon Prime member since the service began, paying nearly $200 annually for fast and reliable delivery. On November 25, 2024, I placed an order that, in bold print, promised same-day delivery for Prime members. After placing the order, I was informed it would arrive the next day instead. Upon reviewing the product page, I noticed in small print that delivery by today required a $30 minimum purchase‚Äîsomething not prominently displayed. This is deceptive and a significant downgrade from the service Amazon Prime used to provide.  Customer service was equally disappointing. Both agents and a supervisor I spoke with appeared to lack concern, offering no real solutions. Despite my request for a U.S.-based agent, I was told the support team is global, though I‚Äôve consistently been connected to agents in India. It feels like Amazon is charging more while offering less value and poor support, especially considering the high costs of living in the U.S.  I‚Äôve filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau and hope Amazon addresses these issues.

Beware of using Amazon in this week alone they have lost 2 of my parcels delivered one to total the wrong address 2 I received with parts missing and I've had diseased plants sent out by a bad seller. On contacting the a z claim dept they won't help with my refund of over ¬£605 all they keep repeating is they need to be sent back I've explained to them irs impossible to send back as the boxes were virtually destroyed when they arrived. Been told to go buy new boxes but I've asked where they think I can get 6ft by 4ft boxes from and basically told its my problem and not there's. So no refund from them no communication from the bad seller. So I'm basically left with ¬£605 worth of diseased plants and amazon couldn't give a monkeys. This is how they treat a prime member for over 25 years and who spends thousands of pounds with them. Never again will I ever buy from amazon they literally can not be trusted.

I am not going to be bullied into signing up for.Amazon Prime, being charged a monthly fee when I'm not buying anything! No way!.Where are the Amazon competitors?. We need options!The last Amazon Fire OS update is preventing me from reading my Spectrum emails on my Kindle.. My research concludes its not on Spectrums end, totally on Amazon due to their low.quality update. Won't use Amazon's email. Won't stay with Amazon if it continues.. They don't care, as I was told,.they have enough customers. They should not have the ability to be a monopoly! They don't care. Lame.updates and increased costs.üò∂"
A White,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Knock on the door and when I answered there was  no one to be seen but there was a box on my door step - just caught a glimpse of some shady looking character leaving my drive. He had no idea if anyone was at home so just dropped the box and legged it. Why do mugs continue to use this vile organisation when almost everything can be purchased elsewhere for less. I hasten to add that it was my son who had made the purchase and sent it to my address.
Duane Allmark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I'm tired of Amazon Prime deliveries getting stuff wrong. Just recently I have had drivers:*Drop stuff at the door and walk way after ringing the doorbell. *I've had them say they've left items at the back door with a photo of a parcel at my front door,*Now I've just been told they tried to deliver but nobody was home, when people were very visibly home (and I have also have my safe place set). They also managed to drive here in lightening fast time, about an hour from their depot which is over an hour away by car, to attempt to deliver my items in bad weather. They used to be my first choice because the service and delivery was so good but they've got lax and greedy now. I've already started finding better deals and shopping elsewhere, might be time to formalise the breakup!Addendum- I've now left Amazon and find better shopping deals elsewhere now. There's better subscription services out there too. For those of you thinking of ditching them I recommend that you do, there are better deals to be had with a more reliable delivery service.The fact that Amazon do not respond to  reviews, like other companies do, speaks volumes about it."
Claire ,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Ordered goods a replacement kindle on 30 October and informed that it would be delivered 14 - 16 November on the morning of 14 November informed that the kindle would be delivered 20 to 28 December.  Funds were taken out of my account when order placed on 30 October.  Raised a complaint as it was now costing me money to purchase books, money had been taken out of my account when goods had not been received,  and up to 2 months from date of order would not receive my goods.  Had to chase for a response to my complaint.  ¬£50 as a gesture of good will would be given and could not move the new delivery date, I was generally informed.  I wrote again asking for a temporary kindle to take me through to the delivery of delayed kindle as it was over the xmas period.  Again had to chase for a response and being told that this wasn't possible.  Reading books off my phone and buying them this is not sustainable and costly despite the ¬£50 gesture of good will payment.  I am likely to read more than usual over the xmas period.  I am so disappointed & frustrated with the service on this occasions for all of the reasons outlined above.  I merely would like a kindle asap until  my new one arrives. "

NathanOr BenZvi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am deeply frustrated with Amazon Seller Account Services. My disbursement issue remains unresolved because of a mistake in the documents I submitted. The message I received stated:‚ÄúYour bank account is not eligible for receiving disbursement due to pending Know Your Customer (KYC) action according to your payment service provider. Please work with your PSP to complete the required action and receive disbursement to the bank account.‚ÄùI use a Payoneer account, and while I acknowledge I submitted the wrong document initially, I have since corrected the mistake and provided the correct documents. Despite this, Amazon‚Äôs support team has been unhelpful and keeps giving me the same generic response without offering a proper resolution.This issue has caused unnecessary delays, and it‚Äôs disappointing that there‚Äôs no clear process to rectify such errors quickly. Sellers should not have to deal with this level of inefficiency, especially when dealing with payments.Amazon needs to improve its support system and ensure that issues like this are handled promptly and professionally. My experience has been extremely disappointing, and I urge them to take seller concerns more seriously."

Mike Harding,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon are to be commended for their recruitment practices. They are willing to employ people who can‚Äôt reach doorbells and / or read delivery instructions as well as being mute. They also are willing to take on future formula 1 drivers who have no consideration for others on the road and firmly believe the Amazon version of the Highway Code allows them to park in the middle of the road.

Offered a re delivery- didn't arrive. 6 yes SIX different agents advised this item couldn't be re delivered and hadn't been processed. Then offered a refund and ¬£5 compensation. Accepted refund,  ¬£5 never happened. Another 'chat' ¬£5 eventually added. Only place I trust a delivery to is a locker and that's not always possible, so I shop elsewhere.

Tyshell Ratcliff,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Drivers are careless and don't pay attention to the address they are delivering to. Ordered shoes for work, app said my shoes would be delivered 11/21. Received a text 11/20 stating my shoes were delivered...get on the app since I went out and no shoes, theres a pic of it delivered...20 hours BEFORE I was notified of the delivery. The driver left it at my neighbors apartment, 1017. Mine is 1021. The address is posted on the building for mine as well as my neighbor apartment. Of course my neighbor lied about them being delivered to him, when I have proof they were. Sad....I have to either invest in a camera or walk 8 blocks for a locker, to guarantee I get my stuff. And I know it was because the driver was rushing and being reckless, I've had packages delivered a few times since I moved here 5 months ago, they always leave them at my door. Driver didn't knock or anything. Amazon really needs to train better "

AW-e,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I enjoyed shopping on Amazon but they have got to stop the new rule of getting free shipping via signing up with Amazon Prime. They want that $6.99. It's like they steal $6.99 from you in punishment for not signing up with their membership. They are pushing and it seems to me they are breaking a rule or law about false advertising. They offer free shipping and have such small letters under it to start a trial. It is sneaky. They count on you a. not noticing and b. paying automatically every month without noticing. Look before you push
Zack,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to love and trust Amazon but for the last couple years I have noticed deliveries becoming later and customer service becoming slower and worse.  The other day I added items on to an order to get above $25 for the sole purpose of same day delivery.  Not only did it NOT come same day, but it is MIA today as well and customer service is saying be patient and come back if it hasn't arrived by next week LOL.  "
Alex A,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer since they opened nearly 3 decades ago. But my last few orders have been disasters. What happens is I place and pay for an item based upon Amazons estimated arrival date. Once Amazon has the order and my money, they delay the shipping and delivery dates repeatedly. Customer service reps do not speak English and only read you lies from a script. "

Anon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Used to be good for deals now all the deals are fraudulent/fake. If you get an amazon price tracker you will see how fake every single sale on their website is.

Doesnt make you trust them to deliver items for Christmas. Buy elsewhere"
Ayim,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has mishandled my deliveries for years.  They never knock, they leave packages on my front porch rather than the side, and they ignore my reviews and requests, dozens of them, to fix this problem.  When they screw up my packages are often stolen.   Twice now, they've blamed ME for the theft, despite my proof of their misdelivery (photo!!).  Amazon is inconsistant, dishonest and unfair."
Maureen Mansell,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Beware of Amazon's delivery policy.  It states you need to spend ¬£35 for free delivery.  What it does not state is this is not free for many products.  There are also click and collect options which it indicates are free but you end up paying the same.  Nothing is clear, nothing is straightforward.  It always appears that Amazon wants to confuse its customers."
Bev N,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"What has happened to Amazon? Generally your service has been good, however, there is an issue with postcodes currently happening (which everyone is talking about on Social media because the delivery times have jumped from an average 2-3 days to 12-14 days), and NOBODY in Amazon has any idea what they are doing, different people giving different reasons that are just proven lies.  I chatted to 7 different people (all Indian names), who just kept leaving the chat so I had to start again.  The 7th person promised they would sort it out and email me, it didn't happen, so the next day I spent nearly an hour (half of which was on hold), repeating myself repeatedly as the Indian (again) person hadn't read any of the chat, could not understand me/I could not understand her and got nowhere.  I asked for a call back from a manager, and the same person called me back to say 'I will try and transfer you to a manager' then after 10 minutes of being on hold again I was just cut off with no call back again.  I emailed and 2 days later still have not received a response.  What the hell is going on with them, their service has just become appalling and they don't give a dam and you can't get ANY help from them at all. I doubt very much this review will illicit any reply from Amazon. Jeff Bazos, you should be ashamed about what your company has become!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Eli,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Terrible customer service. Have received 2 products in the past week where one was broken/defective and the other wasn‚Äôt the item I purchased. Ever since Bezos left, it feels like Bozos took over. Thankful I‚Äôve cancelled my prime membership. Time to use big box stores instead. At least I will know what I‚Äôm spending my money on and if I have to drive to UPS every time I receive a wrong or damaged product, might as well go to a store myself."
Carlota,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After years of shopping on Amazon I attempted to review an item and was blocked from posting/submitting the review. The message I received was that I had not met the minimum eligibility requirements to make a review. I have no idea what the message meant. I've never been verbally inappropriate when reviewing merchandise I purchase on the site but I'm always honest. After seeing the message I immediately called customer service and they would not help me. I called corporate and a young lady suggested emailing a community help address who do not respond. I've tried calling and speaking with several people to no avail. I've never encountered any type of problem with Amazon and I'm very disappointed with this incident. Extremely bad PR!
Louise Mason,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon have sent my last 3 orders to my old address even though I requested they be sent to my new address which is also set at default because you can't delete your old addresses! üôÑ no help from customer service, they don't reply.

Shannon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,It's ok. You can just keep me locked out of my account indefinitely because I'm never giving you another dime for the way you treated me today.  I want a prorated refund for the Amazon Music Unlimited that I paid for a month in advance until you revoked access to my account. I want my money back for the days I no longer have access because of you.  Please also remove my payment information from my account because I am never using or buying any of your products or services so long as I live I promise you.  I was on the phone and online with customer service for 6 hours and every time I tried to get help every signle one of you locked my account up even harder.  I bet you locked my account so hard that even the NSA doesn't know what's in my shopping cart.  You will never get another penny from me. Because you treated me like dog**** and I'll remember this forever.. i hope you get locked out of your car and the locksmith tells you to go **** yourself. Goodbye.
Tim,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've had a really frustrating experience with Amazon's gift card balance. I have a significant amount just sitting in my account, and I can't use it for my orders. Every time I try, my orders get canceled without any clear explanation. This has been incredibly disappointing and feels like a huge waste of money/a scam. I expected better from Amazon, but this issue has made me reconsider using their services. I wouldn't recommend reloading your Amazon gift card balance if you want a smooth shopping experience."
tr mac,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I give crapazon a 1 star review because a negative 100 star is not possible. Crapazon is guilty of false advertising 100%. They state returned are easy but nearest Purolator is 45 minute drive from me and cost 20 pluses dollars in gas but crapazon will not reimburse me the cost so in the long run it is costly and inconvenient to return there falsely advertise product. Anyone else has the same problem well I want to start a class action lawsuit along with my small claims lawsuit so reply to this review and we will sue Jeff Bezos for falsely advertising product's as he is responsible for advertising on his website as he needs to take responsibility of crapazon

Applebear l,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've done business with amazon for many-many years, and it's had some hiccups but overall I've been satisfied until they swapped to usps. Now packages are delayed/don't arrive and when you are able to get through to customer service, you just get lied to. I was offered compensation for my last package that got both delayed and lost, and when I messaged back for the partial refund they promised, I was told the agent was wrong for doing that, and they would not honor it. I shrugged, and have since taken my business elsewhere. If they don't want my money, I'll go to someone that does [with same prices, product, and better courier]."
London,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After 15 years of buyig via Amazon I decided to delete my account! The company is so rich that has total lack of care for customer satisfaction and care!

Amazon refused and all customers associates were very rude and impatient. They even crossed talked while I was trying to put up my concern. I think amazon has outsourced its customer‚Äôs service department to some other country. In my opinion India. Unfortunately India has a culture of very bad customer service that reflects in their attitude.

Ben J,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Two things have stopped me from using Amazon again.1)   We were buying Churro Himalayan Dog Chews but were being consistently shorted.  Supposed to be 16 / package and with each shipment only received between 11 to 15.  I reported this to Amazon customer service each time.  At first Amazon set replacement packages, but then Amazon simply pushed the issue to Churro.   They did not try to resolve that Churro was shorting customers.2)   I ordered an RV water filter and RV water heater anode.    These were to arrive in one package and I received an email stating both items were delivered in that one package, but the water filter wasn't there.Reported this to amazon Customer Service, they said I needed to return the Heater Anode I had already installed to get a new Anode ( no longer needed) and Filter delivered.   I asked for a manager and the rep simply left the call.   I then contacted Amazon via chat and after explaining the situation, that rep left the chat with the message ""Revert to email"".   The email he sent was just a customer service survey.    So Amazon would not refund or resend the Water Filter I purchased and they did not send.   Amazon's Customer Service has become pathetic.   I'm done."

I know this will change again and I can't go pout because one of the items has to have an adult sign for it. This really is the last time I use Amazon. I have far better things to do with my life than spend it waiting by thew door for deliveries which half the time don't even turn up on the day stated. Couple that with the lack of quality of the products and they aren't worth using. I HAVE DONE! And who is writing their 5* reviews? Every single one looks fake!!

So not only have they scammed me multiple times into adding other things to my order, but I now have to get in my car and drive to drop the crap off, rather than just canceling it. At the moment I'm debating canceling Prime since the latest 2 times they have done it, both of those items are still on their website as overnight delivery. Yet they are obviously NOT."

BE AWARE is the return go back to the seller and not Amazon return center check after a month that Amazon not charge you again for the product you return, some seller (special the one from outside the country) report not received the  product so if you don't have the return label from the place you drop is possible that you lose the product and your money."

I did ...today...and after being transferred to eight different people...some of whom said they were unable to see the previous messages so I had to re-write all of the information again, someone finally said that they cannot refund the difference, that I need to return the mattress and re-buy it at the lower price.  I said that I had wished that the person I first contacted the day after buying the mattress had told me that....it would have been easier to do before the mattress was even shipped.  Now I have to send a 150 lb. mattress back and re-order it.  That is ridiculous.  Unfortunately the price difference is significant enough to have them pick up the new mattress and then deliver another one.  You would think they would honor the price difference. Now when I ask how to send the mattress back, the customer service people keep leaving and I get transferred to more people once again.  They just keep saying I am sorry for the inconvenience caused to youPlease allow me a moment to check the detailsThank you for waitinglooks like I'll need another team member to help you with this. I'll connect you with them now.  And that is all they are doing now.  I am on person number 12.  Since I am working on the computer today, I will wait to see how many times this happens or if I ever get anyone who can issue a refund for the price difference or who will tell me how to return such a large item.

A much smaller product I ordered.  Never came.  There customer service lied . Told me my card had been used kn another amazon account.  Wrong.  They didn't take the payment on order date. Order was never delivered,  received 8 emails stating I'd not get the product,  if I'd not received the refund in 14 days. Call customer services.  I did. They then issued the refund. 2 days later I got the refund. Abd 2 minutes later it was took out my account,  I'm now confused, I call customer services.  They gave me instructions to contact my bank,  I did.  What they told me was even more confusing.  I contacted amazon customer services.  They then said someone had used my card on another account.  And paid the exact on another product.  THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE.   So called my bank the next day,  they unfolded the hole issue. Day of original purchase,  amazon didn't take the money,  and to cover there mistake,  paid in the money. Abd took it out. So I never actually lost any money. But came up with do much crap yo cover there mistake   put me through over 3 hours of phone calls. Never got the product.  Left me feeling do angry üò†  iv now took the app off my phone.

sharlene ramsey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"NO customer service.  Took me a few hours to find out there is absolutely no customer service available, even though their site says they are there to help.  Every link, even the links with an image of a phone bring you back to a page of prior purchases.  There is no way to complain or talk to a person or even 'chat'.  I'd give zero stars if possible.  They've been happily taking my money for premium service for years without ever telling me they offer the same service at half price for people on a fixed income, like me.  As well, their site pretends to have someone available if help is needed, which you have to spend hours finding out no help for any kind if a problem actually exists. "
Miss J Ford,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Poor customer service management are all so a disgrace the outsourced delivery is diabolical they deliver to the wrong address try to get a refund for a dodgy item they don't want to know 
CY CY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Their refund policy is a total crap. I returned an item more than a week ago and they refuse to issue the refund until they receive the item, I mean, come on people, is not my fault that UPS take forever to deliver a package. Amazon quickly take your money when you buy from them but if you need a refund (your money) they guard themselves behind their crappy policy. And btw, their customer service sucks!"
Kate,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve had nothing but great experience from Amazon as a customer. The staff are always polite and resolve my issues very quickly. I‚Äôm a prime member and really enjoy the benefits of being one. I‚Äôm shocked at the bad reviews as this is not my experience at all. I‚Äôve been a prime member for over 6 years and I‚Äôve had other subscriptions within amazon. Cancelling subscriptions are easy for me. Other companies I buy from either deliver late, package is destroyed etc which is very frustrating and not forgetting that their resolution can be time consuming. Amazon resolves issues very quickly and packaging is fantastic. The problem is when you buy from third party suppliers. This is when Amazon‚Äôs support is limited but they still try everything to fix the problems. I always go for Amazon products because they are cheaper and fresher and you avoid third party issues."

Shane Ogley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but my recent experiences have been nothing short of appalling. It‚Äôs clear that their service has significantly deteriorated, and I‚Äôm beyond frustrated.First, I had to return a faulty Roborock S7 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum, which was a nightmare to return. Despite Amazon promising to arrange collection, they failed to turn up several times. I ended up having to organise the return myself.Then came the refund fiasco. Amazon initially promised my ¬£799 refund would be credited to my Gift Card balance within 2-3 hours of them receiving the item. That didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, I‚Äôve been given conflicting and misleading timelines‚Äî2-3 hours, 24 hours, then 30 days! To date, After complaining, they sorted my refund.Thinking this was a one-off issue, I purchased another item. Big mistake. This time, the order didn‚Äôt even arrive when I had taken the day off work - they told me they attempted delivery but the item was never ""out for delivery"", and I waited in all day. Amazon is no longer the reliable service it used to be, and its customer support is practically useless, offering no real solutions for its repeated failures.I‚Äôve had enough of the delays, broken promises, and terrible communication. It‚Äôs unacceptable for a company this size to treat customers so poorly. Amazon has lost my trust, and I won‚Äôt be buy larger more expensive items from them again. If you‚Äôre thinking of using Amazon, don't buy expensive goods as they're not reliable.  "

Johanna,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company my ***. Their customer service has gone from a solid 10 to -100000. Absolute garbage.

They have the most useless, incompetent and mediocre customer service I've ever seen."
VJoha,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I used to find Amazon a great place to shop, however it has been flooded with cheap and tatty products, I don't trust it now as I've been disappointed so many times. Also even well branded products often arrive damaged or in poor condition and have to be sent back. Which is now difficult as they no longer provide an option to print your own label. The number of times I've had problems with QR codes as machines are broken, or the 'box not needed' (I already have a box!) is atrocious. I dread having to send stuff back as it's such a hassle. Now that returns are so difficult, and the tacky products, I only use Amazon if it's unavoidable."

Martin Hobbs,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I thought Americans knew what customer service was. No one I have spoken to Amazon have a clue what service is. Amazon US is incapable of shipping a global order. I bought a hard drive that was to be shipped in 7 days globally. It went to DPD and pinged around a number of US locations before being marked undeliverable. This is not the first time this has happened to me on a US order. Decided to complain to customer service, went from person to person and ended up with a manager called 'Sarah'. She like all the people before offered no real customer service. Pre written messages, none of which were helpful or resolved anything. When I asked to complain about the abysmal service she said she was the highest level person at Amazon that dealt with customers. I asked to complain about her service to her manager and she cut off the chat. Awful company."

Richard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had been giving Yumove, a supplement to aid mobility to my dog for about 6 months and had  noted a significant improvement in her mobility. So I have no doubt that  the product is effective.Having done what most people do nowadays, which is look online to see if I could find it cheaper I placed an order on Amazon. Some months later I received an email informing me that counterfeit products may have been supplied by a third party seller I tried to return the order I had recently made.  This was when the problems started.  Despite the website saying the product was eligible for return, when I tried to do this I was told it was not eligible. Clicking on the ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô tab just took me back to where I started. An endless loop leading nowhere. Nothing I tried took me to anywhere I could get help. Eventually I emailed Amazon CEO and this did eventually  lead to the issue being resolved, at least with the order I wanted to return. The point is I should not have to go to these lengths to exercise my statutory right to return a product. Amazon,  your system for requesting returns is not fit for purpose. And when your website has a link which says contact us then that is what customers should be able to do. Contact in my view is a link to a phone number or email, none  of which appear anywhere on your website. Thank goodness for Google, from where it is easy to find the CEO email. "

DavidB,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I've been an Amazon customer for twelve years now and this recent experience has caused me to cancel all of my subscription orders and my Prime membership.Up until around 2019, my overall experience with Amazon has been good.  They offered an excellent selection of products at very affordable prices, with shipping that rarely had any issues.  But since then, I have noticed a constant drop in their selection and their shipping quality.  We used to purchase many grocery type items from Amazon, but over the past five years, we've had multiple issues of dented cans, crushed containers and damaged food items all due to terrible packaging.  Most of this could have been avoided by not choosing to pack more fragile food items with heavier cans, with a mere strip of brown paper as packing material.Also, there have been dozens of items arriving at the post office with spit open seams, due to sloppy and inadequate taping of the shipping boxes.  Our Post Master had to re-tape these packages up himself in order to keep the items inside from spilling all over the post office floor.  I brought this issue to the Amazon customer support team seam several times, but the problem has never been fixed.Recently, now, our shipping times (as a Prime member) has gone from five to seven days to five weeks, with no explanation from Amazon as to why they cannot deliver what a Prime membership promises.Amazon has gone from a ""hero"" to a ""zero"" and we are now turning to alternative services when ever we can.  I'm very disappointed with Amazon and cannot recommend them to anyone anymore."

I have no doubt that on 27 November they will say something else is happening and I must wait forever. Appalling.

AP,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon ignores fraudulent charges.  6 charges not related to my account were made.  Called Amazon to report the incident.

Ray W.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently had my 5 Blink security cameras go down, which when it happens it is almost impossible to fix.  I knew calling Blink was worthless and again this time it was.  After several attempts to get help from the rude, condescending and non English speaking tech support, I tried to reach Amazon, who owns Blink.  Every Amazon agent just transferred me back to the Blink techs and every time, over at least 5-6 times was cutoff.  I would share that with each subsequent Amazon representative and they ignored what I said and just sent me back to Blink, only to be cutoff again.  So I reached out to  the Amazon executive call center and the response sounded like they would resolve this.  I was sent back to Blink and their response was ""we may provide training"".  It felt like they didn't believe my experience and their response was delayed by a few days without even listening to the calls.  Amazon seems to be moving from a company that once cared about customer service to one that ""cancels"" you if you expect them to fix the issues they have.  I have everything from receiving used items in the past when I paid for new.  They use a lot of Chinese products that come damaged or not quality products.  So their belief that a statement that sounds like they don't even believe you that this happened, when they would have had several calls with their own employees at Amazon and Blink, their own company, to review, shows their recent decline in quality products and then no customer service.

David Gill-Collis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a gift in time for Amazon's 1-day delivery service with Prime. On delivery day the gift status showed me it wasn't due for delivery until the next day. What is the point of having a 1-day service? I tried to cancel the order as it hadn't been dispatched, but the Amazon monkeys refused to cancel. What a waste of time - the gift will be delivered late, I will return it as no longer needed because it's too late, and this kind of shoots down the Amazon ""grren"" policy in flames. Not the first time this has happened either, which is one of the reasons I'm not renwing my prime membership (the other reason being that Prime TV is total garbage these days)."
Norma Mallinson,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Usually never have problems when ordering from Amazon unfortunately just lately delivery's has become a joke.My opinion is don't order more than one item if you have free delivery with Prime.Just order items all on different orders.This way it just might stop Amazon delivering one item on order and then saying that they have delivered other on the same order when they have not. It makes you believe that some drives can't read and only recognise numbers has some items have been delivered to wrong address only thing in common is the number.One item comes through letterbox that day then other items that don't arrive say they were posted through letterbox.Makes you believe that there are a lot of scams going on.

The CS agent politely and encouragingly agreed, so we bought the product.The product turns out to be, as we feared, different from the advertised description. So we immediately contacted Amazon. After more than an hour chatting with six agents, including two supervisors, we were told our only return option is to drive over four hours away from our home to drop off the falsely advertised item. Amazon wouldn't budge. We don't see how this is legal. How can Amazon get away with ""allowing"" returns within their advertised return window but then forcing consumers to return items--either defective items or falsely advertised items!--to drop off centers hundreds of miles away from their homes? There are two Amazon drop off centers close to our home, but Amazon wouldn't let us return the product to either of those.Google the number of state and federal cases against Amazon right now for deceptive or potentially illegal business practices, including one by the US government itself and others by 17 US states for monopolistic abuse. Often, Amazon is the only place to get products because it has out-competed local businesses due to its purchasing power. But then it makes it very hard for many consumers to return goods within the ""guaranteed return period."" Reprehensible. "
Dr. COLIN THOMAS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My rating is for the Amazon Delivery Service which has recently deteriorated in my experience. The problem is that deliveries are being left outside my neighbours houses even though I have given comprehensive written instructions on finding the location of my secure porch safe place. The fact that I am registered disabled does not seem to make any difference either.Disappointing.
Mags Roche,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Delivery chain problems.  Amazon used to be relied upon to deliver on time and had excellent customer service. Sadly now that service is mediocre at best. Delivery is outsourced (Evri seem to be a favourite in my area) so items arriving on time or sometimes at all is a distant memory.  Customer sevice seems to now in the main be bot driven with platitudes about people being a 'valued customer' replacing actual useful help. On a positive note I am buying less impulsively and using local and independent shops much more where I receive excellent customer service and definitely feel valued. Maybe more people should do this?
WILSON JUNIOR,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I made a purchase of an Apple Watch Series 9 on the Amazon.com website on June 27, 2024. The payment was made with a Visa debit card. On June 30, 2024, the purchase was canceled by Amazon.com, and I was informed that a refund would be issued. On July 27, 2024, the refund was processed. However, after several weeks, the refund had not appeared on my debit card.I tried to contact Amazon.com but was unsuccessful. I also tried to reach out to Visa but, again, without success. When I attempted to contact Amazon, they stated that more than 120 days had passed and that they could no longer access my data. This, in my opinion, does not make sense, as they have access to all the information related to my account and purchases.When I contacted my bank, they requested proof of the cancellation from Amazon.com. I sent a screenshot showing the information on Amazon‚Äôs website, but they informed me that it was insufficient"

Carletta C,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon used to only have quality products/stores on their website, now it's all garbage from China. When I leave an honest review they find a reason to remove it.

-wall-,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On November 3rd I made two orders (406-6205744-7415524 for 545.8 euros, 406-7853729-7648361 for 272.9 euros, total for 818.7 euros, both seller and delivery person are Amazon itself), when ordering I was informed that I would receive the goods today, 11/14/2024.I was ready to wait these 11 days, as the price of the goods suited me.Today is 11/14/2024 and I was expecting to receive the long-awaited goods, but suddenly instead today I received emails that both orders were unilaterally canceled by Amazon today due to the lack of goods.As a result, I wasted a lot of time, while I could not spend 818.7 euros buying goods elsewhere, as this money was stuck in Amazon.Big disappointment."

Charles Miller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have a business which relies on products purchased for repairs with our customers. I reached out to customer support today and explained that my orders were not arriving during our shops business hours. I was told that my order for today was going to be delivered before we closed but it never came. It‚Äôs still out for delivery hours after we have closed! We have no drop box on a very busy road so the driver cannot leave it. We spend thousands every year and have been forced to drive back to town to meat the driver and sometimes missing them. I pay to have it delivered to me! I am canceling my subscription tomorrow and switching to Walmart for deliveries of products! Very disappointed and unhappy!!!!! Amazon wont care because we are just a number.
Robert Dorazio,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I like much about Amazon: TV service: broad scope of products at fair prices.  But ultimately, at their heart, they are a large company more worried about profits than honesty or customer service.  When I had a problem with a supplier shipping me the wrong product (twice) they said they would refund money to my credit card, but never did. They instead chose a gift card I did not ask for nor was it what they promised. Have no sense of keeping their word if their supplier is a mess. I am minimizing my Amazon purchases going forward, as I would with any  too large business that lost its customer focus "

Jena Mathers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Woah- boy has AMAZON gone WAY DOWN HILL. First of all nothing ever arrives in 2 days- like they claim. Second of all, items are missing from my packages about 50% of the time. Recently, I made an order and an item was missing. When I contacted Amazon- they required I EMAIL them all the information about my purchase- despite the fact that it was ordered on my account and they can easily access all of the information themselves. Then I had to wait 3 days for a response- well 10 DAYS later- they still hadn‚Äôt responded or refunded me. So I then contacted them again- only to be told I now have to provide a valid ID and wait another ‚Äú3 days.‚Äù They are yet to send me any information on how to submit my ID- so I have no way of ever getting a refund. This is will be my LAST purchase from Amazon- they are LIARS (nothing every comes in 2 days) and THIEVES (they will charge you, fail to mail an item, and then refuse to refund you, despite you following all of their unreasonable and unnecessary demands.)"

A V A,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon‚Äôs mostly trustworthy when it comes to deliveries, for the exception when I travel and use them at hotels. In addition, I‚Äôm not too fond of their customer service via chat - I get different stories from one agent to the next. While it‚Äôs super easy to order from their app for anything and everything, I‚Äôm not keen on the numerous products sold which are made in China. It‚Äôs unfortunate and should be weeded out. In addition, their prices aren‚Äôt the best at times as they do spike up. I see this happen one too many times on items we restock such as bottled water, paper towels, toilet paper, Spindrift, etc etc etc. In addition, I‚Äôm not one to make returns often but recently have noticed they switched up their return policy where you can no longer print a label and ship it back. You have to either stop in a Whole Foods, Staples or UPS to drop off your returns with a QR code. While this appeared to be convenient to others, it is not for me. This is actually more of a pain in the @$$ as I‚Äôm nowhere near all three and it‚Äôs easier for UPS to pick up the package from me. On top of that, if you want UPS to pick it up - Amazon will charge you $7 for a box and label. I don‚Äôt need either as I can provide a box but just need them to allow printing label off their site. This option should be made existent and for no charge. What I do thoroughly enjoy is the fast Prime delivery - we must live somewhere close by to one of their warehouses because we have the pleasure of receiving packages overnight or same day. All in all, it‚Äôs a neutral 3 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è for me. "
Carol,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I get groceries at lower prices and in bulk than in local stores. I pay a low monthly delivery fee. Very happy with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. I recommend them.
Steven,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has went completely down hill. I had a big order and when it arrived (shipped multiple things in one box) something was missing. Well I called them and the guy wanted me to fill out an online form. But I didn‚Äôt have internet access at the time. And asked for help. Well I got hung up on. Now I‚Äôve filled out the form 3 times and it‚Äôs still incorrect. After following the exact directions. This is the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. And now that purchase has been flagged for security reasons. And I have to verify my identity to submit another form. But yet I can still use Amazon if I don‚Äôt. This is a sad world we live in when the one thing that used to make people happy could care less about us now.

T Clegg,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but my most recent experience was negative and has left me truly disappointed. I was expecting a parcel later in the day, and knowing I wouldn‚Äôt be home, I selected my rear garden as a safe place for delivery. I received a text message confirming the parcel had been delivered and even claimed it was handed over to a neighbour.However, when I returned home two hours later, I found a large box sitting at my doorstep. I checked with my neighbours, and none of them had received the package. This is extremely concerning, and I can‚Äôt understand why the delivery driver handled it this way. There could be many reasons for this: poor management, drivers taking shortcuts, lack of proper training ‚Äî the list goes on.I was lucky that the package wasn‚Äôt stolen, but it could have easily been. After reading other reviews, I see this is a common issue, which is very concerning. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had problems like this, and it feels like Amazon is losing its commitment to customer satisfaction and no longer takes feedback seriously. Experiences like this are making me seriously reconsider purchasing anything from their website again.I‚Äôm just really disappointed. I expected better service from a company of Amazon‚Äôs size and reputation, but it seems they are not listening or improving based on customer feedback."

The purchases were made in America, actually the hacker even went as far as to add Prime to my account, for free delivery!!After this I refused to give account details to verify myself, as asked to by Amazon, therefore my account remained on hold! Since my account being on hold from the end of October to now I have had continuous emails from Amazon, advising me of ‚Äòsuspicious activity‚Äô and amazingly apparently I left 14 reviews for products I have not even purchased!!! After going through the Hell to speak with a customer service advisor I was basically told ‚Äòsorry your own data is being used in the USA‚Äô we can‚Äôt do anything!!! Interesting!!! To try to protect my data being used by hackers I insisted that Amazon delete my account, over the phone! Apparently this is not an option because other departments don‚Äôt have telephones!! Then she put the phone down on me. Apparently I cannot delete my account, because I don‚Äôt have access to it, because it‚Äôs on hold, due to hacking!

I only found out that if you've bought goods from a 3rd party seller, then amazon won't have anything to do with the delivery or complaints regarding this.Fair enough, but, I did not pay the 3rd party seller, I gave my money to amazon, thinking they protected my buying goods and the service I received, obviously not.

Robert Byrne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered 4 reams of paper, which arrived opened and some of them filthy, as if dropped on the ground. I ordered from AMAZON US to Ireland. I chatted online with a dozen agents, some of who rudely hung up. They say return the item and get a refund. This is unacceptable as it took 2 weeks to arrive and I have the inconvenience of returning items to simply get my money and have no items.I asked to speak with an agent on the phone, they told me use ""request call back"" option which does not work for Ireland. Then they gave me a phone, which states is no longer in use, once you call it. Despite being told about all this and having to repeat myself over and over again, as agents rudely hung up the online chat. They say nothing they can do. How can it be that my only option to simply get my money back and forget about any inconvenience, is to go out of my way to return damaged items and when I do, I am without the item I needed in the first place. This is SHOCKINGLY poor from Amazon. I'm extremely disappointed by the apparent ""customer service""."

I am a pensioner and my money in my hands is very much needed.   I am very angry and will probably not buy from Amazon Canada anymore this item was shipped and sold by Amazon Canada and was returned on November the 1st at your Warehouse in Richmond, BC 5940 Ferguson Road  V0Y 2A2.  The item was for $470.39 on order numberOk so now I have been told I would receive a credit of $450.18  instead of the full amount which I am due the full amount of $470.39  with a difference of $20.21 which I was told it was because of freight return, which I should not be paying because my item was not shipped in the time frame you advised me it would take I received it 4 days later than I should have got this item. I think it is very appalling that you have to penny pinch on your customers when you made the mistake of not delivering this item as promised. My order was on Oct. 21st 2024 and promised this faucet for my kitchen on Wednesday but I never recieved it until the 27th that constitutes a free return in my eyes.WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME I REALLY WANT TO KNOW?There was no third party involved in this transaction. Now I am also upset that I have to talk to someone in India with regards to this matter, with jobs needed by people in the USA and Canada I feel very strongly about these jobs being kept in our own Countries, the language and attitudes from the people we talk to in these Countries is somewhat to be desired.

Just want to return both toys, but delivery person didn't photograph, so cannot get return label and RMA # from Amazon. Get an email that order is delayed, but I've had it over a week. Call and get run around. Chat line says to pay $1 (refundable) and experts are on line to help. I'm not paying anything, just want to return the toys. I've called and talked last week, and person with heavy accent said to call back this week. chat line is no help. I need to return the two toys on that order.

Anthia Leonidas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing this review to express my deep disappointment upon discovering that Amazon is selling counterfeit goods. As a UK graphic designer and artist with online stores specialising in wall art and typography, I have dedicated the past decade to creating 1000s of unique designs from scratch. Each design is a reflection of my personal brand, and I have taken measures to ensure their authenticity, such as using distinct background colors and other identifying features.It is disheartening to see my hard work being copied and sold without permission. Despite my efforts to protect my designs with logos, watermarks, and other safeguards, these counterfeiters continue to exploit my work for their own gain. This not only undermines the integrity of my brand but also poses a threat to the livelihood of small businesses like mine.The practice of selling counterfeit prints and canvases at rock-bottom prices not only devalues the work of legitimate artists but also contributes to the decline of the economy and small businesses. If Amazon is going to allow their re-sellers to offer prints and canvases at such low prices, they should at least have the decency to make sure the designs and mockups are original rather than stolen from hardworking artists like myself.In conclusion, I implore Amazon and other seller platforms to honour the creative endeavours of artists and designers and cease the sale of counterfeit goods. It is crucial that we maintain ethical standards within the online community to guarantee the ongoing prosperity and longevity of small businesses. Despite my efforts to have my items removed, I have encountered significant challenges. Therefore, I will persist in my review until I receive a response. Thank you for your attention to this matter."

Nancy Anway,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I've ordered two gifts for my children for their birthday a week and a half before their party today I only received one of them. Worried that I would not get the other one in time I yesterday ordered overnight gifts for them and now they're not coming till tomorrow their party is today. I reached out to the supervisor at least four times I am deeply disappointed in the service I got. They are minimizing the fact that I need an expedited shipping and then I needed the product for today for my children. I don't know if you're a parent but it's important for your kids to open up something on their birthday no matter how old they are. I ordered their first gifts more than a week ago should have got them and have not. Be careful ordering from Amazon now because you may not get your product on time. Deeply disappointed today 
whally tever Whall,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Even though I pay for Amazon prime plusMore and more products are charging $6.99 for shipping unless you purchase more than $35 worth of items. Also, they pretty much stopped free returns as you have to drive somewhere to drop it off. This is not free. So why pay for Amazon prime plus? I‚Äôve switched to Walmart."
Jamie W,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I found out the hard way that Amazon also uses traders.When my fleece zip failed in no time at all, I discovered I didn't buy it from Amazon but a trader, like on Ebay. They replaced it with something different and worth half the price. FAIL  How do I get a refund now?NEVER use Amazon again."
Myles Neely,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've been using amazon for a few years now and they are constantly getting worse I ordered an item and when it eventually arrived it was absolute rubbish  made from cheap materials it was nothing like what was described and when I left a bad review it was taken down claiming I was abusive when I called the item rubbish , now I've recently moved address and they won't let me change my delivery address I tried contacting customer services which was a waste of time evidently I've ended up deleting my account permanently I will not be shopping through amazon again "
Lucy Davies,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Total inadequate customer service and withholding refund for weeks. Several calls later and made legally aware they eventually returned the money. One of their courier company Evri is just as bad.  Will avoid using as much as possible.
Jodie Wood,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would rather rate them 0 they seriously need to see what sort of people they hire to deliver because we bought a mobile phone and the driver as robbed it and they can disable your ring doorbell so be very careful what you order from Amazon 
Richard Moreham,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They are strange decision makers like they asked me to review the seller and suggested points about the product to review then send me an email saying they took the review down because I rated the product and not the seller ? I also bought some shoes they fell apart in a week so I sent them back because they fell apart in a week and they said stop returning product because they fall apart this company is ridiculous 
Scott Mathew,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Customer service either being told to lie or their system is in need of serious upgrade, all my Christmas shopping going to the high street. They don‚Äôt care anyway. "
Julie Elcock,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I won't be using Amazon again. The drivers just leave parcels outside the front door and don't bother to knock and just leave them there for people to come and take.I also have an issue with the Prime membership which I had through Amazon and this evening Google Play tried to take it from my bank account. I never did it through Google Play. Bloody scam artists. Shopping is supposed to be enjoyed not cause mental stress every time you shop with them
Mr G LYDIATT,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Yet again, I waited in for several hours as the Amazon site said my delivery would be here by 6.00pm, then it was changed to 8.00pm and finally ‚Äòwe‚Äôre sorry but the delivery will definitely be with you by 10.00pm‚Äô.What a shock! The next message is that if it‚Äôs not delivered within a further two days I can apply for a refund. So having wasted an entire Saturday afternoon and evening they want me to wait in for another two days.An incompetent company with no concept of customer service. Shocking. I‚Äôm done with Amazon and will never use them again!"

robert ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After recent service and your not allowed to put anything about delivery experience on amazon reviews.  Nor will they actually answer what happened to it . I ask with the message to leave items in safe place but this is now being ignored.  I had a delivery with 2 items said they could not be delivered were not valuable or needed signed for just never bothered . Another item said it was delivered thankfully I have a doorbell camera seen driver walking away with parcel.  I was told I signed for it basically would have been my problem.  They delivered to a neighbour but don't know to whom . Over 200 houses n flat at my area where do I look .
Rune Andreasen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a charger.I waited for half a month, dident recieve anything.looked through my phone and email, got no message about the delivery.eventually I logged into my account, which in it-self was a hassal.and found out that the order had failed, and I hadent received any message about it.so I tried to go to customer support, and got nothing resolved, was just told it will fix it-self.so now I have been waiting since, and gotten no product, and no refund.simply because of their bot infrastructure.that cant even figure out how to message me, nor how to solve any issues.and now I have paid 70 euros for a charger, dident get the product, nor the refund, and their support are incapable to understand my situation and fix it.they told me that I will get a refund in a months time.which I am not sure about, since I will have no way of knowing if anything goes wrong.they dont message me anything, to my phone, nor my email.so I can only assume that I am not going to see those 70 euros again.I tried to make it clear for them that I dident receive any message last time, and I wont automaticly receive it, but they dosent realy comprehend my situation."
Jenny Eddy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 40 barefoot wallflowers from Bryncir Garden Centre through Amazon on 21st September and they arrived on 25th.  The plants were completely useless packed laid down and very wet and smelly - most of them only had a stalk remaining.  Contacted seller with photos but reply suggested we should have planted them sooner (how could we when we did not possess them?) No apologies or refund.  Contacted Amazon a total of 4 times but a suggestion was to send back the smelly mess !! and this was after many days of trying to get a result - sending them back after a fortnight was unrealistic and photos had been sent on day of receipt.  Amazon claimed to have contact the seller and at one stage suggested a refund by Amazon.  The final message from Amazon was that we had not complied with the terms and conditions.  If this was not a case for a refund what on earth is ?  Avoid Bryncir Garden Centre.
Aaron Maher,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon are refusing to give my money back for items they have shipped that are damaged and scratched, they have said that for them to refund my money they would like to see copies of my passport for their records and for them to archive as a way of keeping customer data.When I have refused they have said this is the new policy and if i would like my money back then send this information in, after this they said they would be now terminating the call.I do not work for amazon, i am now travelling to the shopping country of Amazon.com, they have no need for my passport details and for them to retain this and their third party, please see the following as a copy paste from their email:Before continuing with your most recent refund request, we require you to submit a valid, government-issued photo identification.We previously requested an ID from you, but you have not submitted one yet. We need your ID in order to complete our investigation and proceed with your refund.We will send you another email with instructions about how to share your ID with Amazon. Once you send us your ID, please allow three business days to complete our investigation before contacting again.Thanks for your understanding.^^^^^This is not acceptable, I have since closed down my prime and will not be using their service further, its a shame that kindle and audible are attached to tax fraudsters who are trying to take passport data.STAY AWAY!!!"
Elizabeth Denise Leggin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This company certainly has gone to hell.Third time THIS WEEK part of my order is DELAYED! Customer service for the most part can care less and they show it (I've gotten 2 CSR that actually cares about me as a human being and customer. They did all they could for me and for that I'm grateful) the rest of CSR can care less. I have never had so many freaking delays in ordering. This company don't care that they constantly take money from the consumer and don't follow thru on their promises of having orders arrive WHEN THEY SAY IT WILL! No wonder why this company gets a 1 star!

Richard Dull,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I tried to return a defective item to Amazon, I went through the entire return process and visited all three UPS drop off points only to be told they no longer accept Amazon returns, customer service, after talking to three people, arranged for pickup at my residence, but I am being charged for the pickup and must be at home from 0900 until 900 on the day of pickup, they stated that it would be picked up the next business day but wasn't sure if that would be Saturday or Monday so I should be available both days or until the pickup happened, I can not lose a day or two of income to return a fifty dollar item, not my fault UPS has some problems with Amazon returns, I cancelled my prime membership that day, does Amazon think they are so important that I will put up with terrible customer service? So now I am out about sixty dollars and three hours of my time, terrible customer service "

graham egan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You make an order (even using Prime) Delivery time slot is 14 hours i.e. anytime before 10.00pm - that's quite insulting. Has anybody tried to contact Amazon?

Eric Stahl,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So on Oct 18, 2024, I ordered a mattress.  They took out 913.00 2 days later, and a week later the tracking said the order was delivered.  I contacted Amazon, because the product did not arrive, at which time the the customer service said it was returned because the address wasn‚Äôt correct, then it was it was to heavy, then it was damaged.  Then I was told I  can‚Äôt get a refund until the product is processed back in to their warehouse.  Then it was 30 days after that.  Then when I explained the tracking showed it back at their facility on the 28th of oct., I asked what is the hold up.  The next day, the tracking disappeared and I received an email stating if I don‚Äôt have my refund by 23 of Nov then to call them again.  I am out over 900.00 and no one can tell me when I am going to get my money back.  I will never use Amazon again and I strongly encourage others not to as well.  They do not care about their customers and they have no problem keeping someone‚Äôs hard earn money for their mistakes.  Amazon is a trash company ran by individuals with poor morals and values."

Stacey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"3rd time this happened.  I select a shipping option then comit to the purchase and pay. Multiple times through out the day I receive delay, expect afternoon,  delay now expected by 10 pm, still delayed...no info item never comes.  Customer service put you on hold 30 to 40 mins and acts shocked and can't seem to give a straight answer.  Also recently I was charged twice for shipping on the same item  but they won't reimburse me until it finally arrives,  there's no estimate for arrival on that package either,  been past a week. So 2 packages in limbo and charged double shipping for one item with no immediate resolution.  Worst customer service.  "
Barry Mallek,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am really sick and tired of ordering a product with next day delivery only to check where my order is and being notified that the item will now be delivered the next day (taking 2 days instead of next day).

Jazzmin Holiday,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I recently had a frustrating experience with Amazon's delivery service. My packages are often carelessly left outside, and sometimes I don‚Äôt even receive them at all. Despite having three different mailboxes, they just refund me when I report the issue instead of addressing the root cause of the problem. As a loyal customer who orders almost daily, I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôve decided to switch to another my items elsewhere . I‚Äôm closing my storefront and won‚Äôt be ordering from Amazon anymore. It‚Äôs time for a change."

dennis danforth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I rarely use Amazon because in my mind, for every item they carry, smaller companies are GENERALLY providing higher quality, fresher, authentic items with superior customer service. Turns out this was more than just a feeling. Bought a 6-pack of smoke detectors that arrived a week after the scheduled delivery date and 3 days after my home sold. Needed em' quickly to meet an inspection requirement. Tried returning them but couldn't do a dropoff at an Amazon-supported location because the seller was a 3rd party. The 3rd-party seller experience is where Amazon seems to fail miserably, as this is the second issue I've had like this. Spent 2 days going in circles with 4 different overseas reps who ask the same barrage of mostly time-wasting questions. The seller barely responded to the CS rep's requests. If a refund eventually comes, I could add a star but why bother at this point. Back to doing business with the reputables."
Joseph Otieno,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I use Amazon a lot and I‚Äôve never had my refund date pushed past the 2 weeks I was told to wait and pushed to 30 days which for a uni student low on funds is crazy. This has been a long enough wait and it says it‚Äôs arrived so this is crazy to me and the fact it was saying the 8th Nov was the last day until the 8th came and it was pushed to the 10th so was it just going to keep on going back until 30 days

I hadn‚Äôt heard a word I called this morning Nov . 7 they accuse me of keeping a good seat when my toilet is currently no seat at all they then said they‚Äôre ending the call , second time I‚Äôm explaining the veneer is very bad on both of them but in different places it‚Äôs the same seat though they hung up again , I called again trying to explain to look at the hinge that connects to the toilet they hung up again , on the fourth call I gave those scavengers my money for FREEEEE ! They could keep the seat why this world is made for you to lose or win at a high price everyone profits from your misfortune I had two strokes a 3 rd could cause me permenant paralysis so I called a fourth time & after 10 yrs of business I closed my account permanently don‚Äôt take replacements the reviews by the way are all extremely terrible for this item ! Amazon is as deceiving as anyone what‚Äôs worse it‚Äôs over the phone & can treat you however they feel like .

Paul Oberlin,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I recently had a bad experience with the customer service representatives. Someone hacked my account and they could see on there end who it was but would not tell me the other person's name. ü§¨ I had to cancel my bank card and get a new one. refund my money and maybe I'll change my review. Other then that I use to like shopping here for stuff online. I realize it's not there fault someone hacks your account but if you know the information on who you should tell the customer who it is so they can have that person prosecuted so it doesn't happen to someone else. These hackers need to be locked away not protected by Amazon.
Sue Mills,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After using amazon for years because of the customer servive and great delivery sad to say its gone crap like evety other company. Missing or undelivered items refuse to refund food delivery with defrosted perished food refuse to refund. As items were defrosted tried to refuse delivery said i had to take items and contact amazon who then refise to refund. Had removed the ability to make a complaint. Customer service transfer you through 10 departments and refuse to refund
Nyes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had a very disappointing experience with Amazon's business services. I ordered merchandise that was promised to arrive by a specific estimated date, but it took nearly a month to be delivered. Despite the early payment, there was no refund option available for business accounts; instead, I was told to simply wait. This is unacceptable.The customer service experience was frustrating as well. I was passed from representative to representative, wasting over an hour just trying to get some clarity on my order. Each time I called, I was informed that no supervisors were available to assist, leaving my issues unresolved.Overall, the lack of accountability and communication from Amazon is concerning, especially for business customers who rely on timely deliveries and support.

One of the orders arrived on time, but the other two haven't even been dispatched yet, and this is after the due delivery date. I've tried to cancel, but all I keep being told is that the order is due for immediate dispatch, and can't be cancelled. Every time I try to speak to someone I've been fobbed off. The combined value of these orders is ¬£80.00, and I've been told that I can't get a refund until my orders arrive Basically, I've been scammed!!!In future I will go without from now on, rather than use Amazon again. They are a disgrace."
Iain Gordon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I contacted Amazon months ago when one of their delivery drivers reversed their van in to my fence and damaged the post. They raised a case and asked me to provide an estimate for the damage which I did, and then they started sending emails with requests for non related information, like what was my delivery package item number and who was the driver delivering too.They were told numerous times the delivery driver was only turning the van outside my home and I didn‚Äôt know where the delivery was made to.I provided CCTV footage of the incident showing the van registration number and they say that they can‚Äôt find anything on their system! They have ignored every email I‚Äôve sent after that.Disgusting company who are dishonest and non trustworthy, they obviously employ a large number of delivery drivers who can‚Äôt drive the vehicles they‚Äôre delivering with, and won‚Äôt even pay for the accident damage they cause. It‚Äôs plain to see the amount of Amazon delivery vans on the roads with damage to them, the amount of them is embarrassing!"

You have absolutely no choice. I brought a ¬£225 specialist tool safe. And the drivers smashed it, dropped it. Scuffed it. Scrated it. Amazon. No matter what I say. Are telling me. I either have to keep it. Loose the money. And dispose of a 40kg lump of metal myself. Or.I have to close my business for a WHOLE DAY. And stay home for a 12 hour COLLECTION slot. And it‚Äôs that or NOTHING To do this I would loose up to ¬£500 in earnings. Wages and costs. So I have absolutely no choice. Amazon got paid. The manufacturer got paid. The cowboy 2 man delivery staff got paid.Yet I now have to loose ¬£225 and I have to pay to dispose of this smashed up metal lump!! Complete con artists. Criminals.  Trading standards should shut Amazon down forever. It‚Äôs destroyed all UK consumer rights!!! Not only that. But still don‚Äôt have the safe I need. It‚Äôs a crucial bit of kit i need.

C R,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been an Amazon customer since 2005, but have completely lost confidence in them. I ordered a Samsung smart watch, which was sold by a third party seller under the Amazon renewed scheme. When the package arrived, the watch and the charging cable were both missing from the box. The only thing inside the box was a (dirty) watch strap. Amazon are refusing to help until a police investigation has taken place and I have provided a copy of the police report. They have given me a hard deadline of 26.12.24 to provide this, otherwise they will refuse to help any further. They have refused to take any responsibility for this (despite their A to Z guarantee), deleted the seller review which I left on the Amazon website (because, apparently, they take responsibility for the fulfilment of this item....) and keep sending me the same template email when I contact them to complain. It's beyond frustrating. "

As done previously with a different site. I do use Amazing throughout the year, more so browsing near the festive time, but hold off on a few orders because of differing posting charges. They soon amount to a fair bit more but for choice, speed and great value they cant be beat. Deliver lads are great delivered on time etc. "
Dear Mr Gordon,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon are becoming a farce. Apart from constantly ordering 6 boxes of tea and getting 1 they've now mucked up ordering kindle books.

That never happened resulting to a further phone call lasting over 45 minutes. The rep kept insisting I should wait for it to be delivered but could not grasp it already had to the wrong address! Had to insist on speaking with a manager who has promised a new delivery but refused any compensation for the time spent and stress caused. I will be cancelling my account and Prime subscription. Totally useless company and only giving one star as I cannot give less."

Patrizia J.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I think with all the 1 star complaints, we should get a class action suit against SCAMazon.This company NEVER delivers as promised when you pay for specific delivery times.  How many other customers are they nickel and dimeing like this (those that DON'T complain as well).I had been waiting on a refund since September 2024. I FINALLY received it as a gift card in my account on 10/25/24. Immediately after that, a hacker used my refund, ordered some chairs to be delivered in Texas.  I called amazon to stop the transaction as it was fraudulent.  These dummies allowed the transaction to go through, she received the chairs she ordered on MY account using MY gift card money and to top it all off - SHE got to keep the chairs, they REIMBURSED her cc for what she paid for the chairs, and I FINALLY got my refund BACK.  What I want to know is are they going to go after this person?  This all started because I ordered a Samsung keyboard that was DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADRESS.  When I called amazon, I asked if the driver could go back and retrieve my package and was told, ""we don't send our drivers back to pick up misdelivered packages"".  I asked the lady, ""so people receiving packages that aren't theirs, get to keep them because your driver misdelivered?"" Her response was, ""unfortunately, yes"".  She sent a replacement order that I received the next day.  The keyboard I ordered looked NOTHING like the photos on amazon and the keyboard was glitch (connects, disconnects, letters don't show up on screen, wrong letters pop up after pressing other keys) so I sent it back for a refund (all in the month of September).  They received the returned keyboard on 9/14/15/2024 and after calling several times, I finally received my refund on 10/25/2024 AND THAT'S WHEN THE DRAMA with amazon CONTINUED!  I don't know who is running their customer service but I wish they'd hire me to get their behinds under control, teach them English vernacular and revamp their scripts AND their protocols because it is DEFINITELY behind times and the accents need to be toned down or SLOWED down so that we can UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE SAYING!!!!!"

October Country,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Waiting 4 months now on a refund for an item that they received back as a return. If you are buying an expensive item and for whatever reason have to return it just initiate a charge back from the bank. They have burned numerous people on returns not being issued at all to returns taking 5 months or more. I have no idea if I'm ever getting my money back. I do know that I am forever finished with Amazon. They randomly closed my account a couple of months ago and I lost all the audible books I paid for. They say they don't close accounts unless the customer requests it. I suppose the Amazon fairy did it then. No one has access to my account except me and I did not request for it to be closed. Upon doing research, I found this has happened to others as well. So they are stealing from us so yeah, I'm done with them."

Susan Simmons,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My order was ""Out for Delivery"" on 11/4/2024. It would have been in a box. When the Amazon driver delivered a package, it was an envelope and not a box. I have this all on security camera footage. I immediately called Amazon. The first person I spoke with was from another country and was very difficult to understand at best. I requested that the same driver go back to my house, deliver the correct package and remove the package that did not belong to me. I was told that was not going to happen as they have no way of contacting the driver. I ended that conversation and called another number and got a young lady on the phone, from another country again, and was told that they would expedite a replacement package and over night that to me. She was very apologetic. AMAZON, lets get real. You have a warehouse here in my town where they load up the trucks daily. That warehouse has a manager and a phone. That manager has the ability to contact the Amazon drivers as the drivers have phones too. If I have to tell you how to do your job correctly, then you need to be paying me. Lastly, the package delivered to me that is not mine - I will be delivering that to the correct person myself. Therefore, you owe me salary for one hour AND gas money. This is not the first time I have had to deliver your packages to the correct customer myself using my car and my time. Your drivers need to do their jobs correctly.

Hire some people that actually speak English as a first language when an American calls, in fact, why don‚Äôt they just put in local call centers for each region so that people can get someone on the line that speaks their language!"
william,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Update 04/11/24 16:52 I had orders being delivered today according to tracking, CS chat agents and managers. So after checking tracking again my orders are delayed again. I have wasted hours with CS chat agents and mostly the managers. They lie and fob you off. They are incompetent, useless waste of a wage. Over the last 6 weeks i have cancelled orders totalling over ¬£1100, Due to delayed deliveries. Ive had enough and taking my custom elsewhere. I made an expensive order for a table saw twice. Twice i had to cancel due to delay after delay after delay. Tracking is extremely untrustworthy. I speak to chat agents who apologise for delays. I then speak to Manager Rameez on a few previous days before after first delay and assures  me i will receive my items today Monday 4th November. I contact chat C.S again to confirm delivery and get told again its delayed. I speak to Manager Devesh who insisted it was out for delivery and there is no delay. He obviously never checked previous chat who told me it was delayed. His attitude began to be offensive so i asked to speak to another manager. Devesh said he cant transfer me to another manager and that i would have to go through chat services again. So again i go through chat services and speak to an agent and again she confirms there is a delay. I speak to another manager who was very helpful and we came to agree to cancel order and she issued a voucher as a goodwill gesture.Devesh is in the wrong job. He clearly isn't doing his job professionally. He was rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic. From the get go with Devesh i sensed his attitude. I will be raising a complaint about him to head office corporate.What has happened to Amazon it used to be so good but over the last couple of months ive noticed a severe drop in delivering goods. "
Michele Cockle,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Been amazon customer for many years. I live in a wheelchair access bungalow, my front door opens out not in. Plenty of signs saying disabled access. But these delivery drivers are putting boxes in front of door, so I am unable to open front door with boxes in front of it. Reported it to Amazon, hoping they sort it. And reviewing the cctv, none of these drivers knock the door, they just dump the boxes & walk off. "
Anthony,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After shopping with AMAZON and spending over ¬£4000 in the last 3 years just on goods alone not including the ¬£4.99 delivery charges every time Today I tried to purchase goods valued ¬£34.98. I was informed that I needed to spend ¬£0.02 to qualify for free delivery! Amazon does not sell anything for 2p.  when I tried to cash out I had to accept Prime free for 30 days then pay 8.99 a month afterwards or pay ¬£4.99 for next-day delivery!? I tried to donate 2p not a chance after searching for an hour or more I got them to ring me. Explained to the gentleman my predicament and how much I had spent recently I suggested that they allow customers to donate a few pence to allow delivery he thought it was a great idea. After being put on hold while he spoke to management AMAZON THE GREEDY B...DS insisted I bought something joined Prime or paid 4.99 delivery charges(I know join Prime for free then cancel don't pay anything) If when that happened previously things had gone smoothly instead of once cancelled we got emails after emails saying our account details had been hacked get in touch suspicious activity contact your bank as it must be them that gave details out etc we had to cancel not 1 not 2 but 3 credit cards in less than a year due to this and all because we cancelled prime The bank was furious when i told them for the 3 rd time Prime was accusing them of giving details out hence why we had to cancel cards AMAZON PRIME SET O9F ROBBING barstewards
Faheem Ahmed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The reality is that the old good days of Jeff Bezos‚Äô amazon with insane level customer obsession are gone. I bought a furniture item from amazon.com. My wife already added it to the cart and by mistake I also added it. So, this way mistakenly order was placed for two qty instead of one. Once I received the email about the order, I noticed that and immediately tried to cancel one item. Amazon didn‚Äôt let me do that and when I phoned them they told me that since the order is already in preparation, I couldn‚Äôt cancel it, however, once I receive the order, I could return it. When I received the item, I found that to return I would have to pay the shipping cost since the item was sold by third party seller. I again phoned amazon and honestly told them that it was my mistake, the shipping charges are too high, so confirm if I‚Äôll get back the shipping cost, and if not, I would donate the second item to some charity. They promised me that shipping cost as well as the item price would be refunded. I asked them to send me an email and they did that. So, I returned the item and once it was received by the seller, I contacted Amazon, sent them the confirmation of the receipt when asked. Then after more than two weeks I found that I have received no refund at all. After talking and chatting 4-5 times, every time they asked me to tell the whole story again, provide them all the receipts etc. and I did that, still no refund. Finally, the case went to a super rude person, who told me that I would not get any refund for shipping cost and for item price I may get a refund. I told the super rude person that I have confirmation email from amazon that both item price and shipping charges will be refunded, the super rude person‚Äôs response was that the amazon agent falsely promised me about the refund.It‚Äôs been more than 25 days since return initiated, I still have received no refund, even for the item price. Lessons learned:‚Ä¢	Never buy large or expensive items from amazon.com. Buy them from Walmart, Target or Costco like good retailers. They have much better return policy and if things go wrong, you will have choice to return the item to the nearest store.‚Ä¢	Never buy anything from amazon third party seller that is not shipped by Amazon. You have a better chance of getting a refund if it is shipped by Amazon.‚Ä¢	Be very careful doing shopping on Amazon. The trust relationship is gone, it is not longer Jeff Bezos‚Äô company with customer obsession. It is no longer a marketplace where you can do shopping with peace of mind that you will not be cheated."

Jon Harbour,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I received five quart jugs of oil from Amazon with broken caps that leaked oil all over the box. there was still about 4.5 quarts in each container so I opted to keep them and use them rather than return them because of the environmental hazard. and I wrote a review of these oil jugs and Amazon revoked my community account and deleted all of my past reviews going back 25 years because I complained about these broken oil jugs. I have had a long history with this company and have bought hundreds if not thousands of products over these decades. but they are so toxic toward reviewers that the review system cannot be trusted at all. trust is earned.I can still make purchases but cannot review any of them afterward. I suppose that means that all of the existing reviews on products are suspect.

Nora,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Return always and forever is a headache, as it is meant to be this way to make people avoid returning, which is a scammer behaviour from a giant online company!!!!!!!When you are buying it is one click and your order is placed, then come to return, you have a million return forced options, you have to go all over the city west to Royal Mail, east to Evri, jump up to the north for Amazon fresh, and then south for UPS, and some needs you to pay even though it said free return, some ask you to print a label! some only drop off. I don't have Royal mail close to me, and I can't be available during the opening hours of RM, I have a full time job!!!Amazonfresh can do a great job in collecting all in one click, but instead, the freaky greedy owner decided that it only take few small parcels and the customer deals with the headache of returning the rest!Everytime I have a huge event and spend thousands on Amazon I end up with the headache of returning and I steer clear from Amazon feeling disgusted even by hearing its name for months after, even when I buy again I only buy small disposable things that I know for sure I will not have to deal with the return of it!Last month I placed a large order with Argos and Amazon, Argos returns were all sorted in one quick chat on same day eve (a Saturday), I am still to date struggling with and wasting time and effort sorting out Amazon returns, starting from wrong collection address, to vague collection day, as opposed to Argos who gave 2 hours collection window!Why not collect and sort all the items at once at Amazon fresh just like all other decent trustworthy retailers in the UK do?!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why can't we have account ID and we take our items and give our ID no to the person there and then we just hand what we have and they click return and collect at the same minute? Or allow all items to be returned in one package? I don't have time to run all over the city to do a million small package returns on behalf of your logistics when your staff delivered all in one parcel!!!!Checking the online reviews it looks like Shein and other giant companies are coming instead, I tried Shein once and for return all items were collected in one bag with no wasted time for me, so maybe it is time for UK customers to move on! Amazon has been there for ages now and still the poorest when it comes to customer service (read the review) so I doubt there are any intentions to care or improve!"
Tengu,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Truly awful services when you have to return a parcel by UPS. There collection times are monday-friday 9-5 which are my working hours, they are unable to provide a time or date for collection so there's no way I can organize a return.

Mr H,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"OK, i use Amazon a lot and 99% of the time no issues at all. Recently we bought some airpods for ¬£179 they sent a ¬£15 copy which we sent back and they sent the right ones, all happy and thought brilliant. Out of the blue an email saying we will be charged as have not sent back original ones. We have proof of postage we have all the evidence but it has taken a ridiculous amount of time and effort to explain the distance selling law to Amazon that if you send the wrong item you have to accept a return and provide the right one. Eventually had to email executive team and even they seem to be righteous saying 'you will not be charged for replacement' So overall a great platform but need to tidy up the customer service end. "
Elizabeth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am incredibly frustrated with Amazon‚Äôs delivery service. This is not my first time shopping with Amazon, yet I consistently face the same issues. The courier service in Cyprus simply does not operate efficiently, or perhaps lacks commitment. My packages are often delivered to my neighbor's door without any prior phone contact, some packages go missing and never reach my home, and even after updating my address following a move, shipments still end up at my previous location. This level of service is unacceptable; my time is valuable, and the delivery fees are far too high for such poor performance. This experience has been extremely disappointing."
Kristy Gorman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After just having an issue 2 weeks ago about the same issue goes to show they don't do anything when drivers refuse to follow instructions. I have a driveway that goes straight to next street. So everyone in the area uses it as a cut through. To the point we are installing a gate. In delivery instructions not only is that stated. Specific instructions are written to leave order INSIDE the side door hall. Reason being packages disappear anytime they don't if I'm not home to get it right away. I am also disabled so now with one leg I have to try to go down and upstairs carrying a package on crutches. 2 weeks ago my daughters package was missing after picture showed it delivered outside. Now today again not even near side door all the way out front up a porch. So had the package been there is was heavier I would have had to try to walk down stairs go around the house up the porch stairs back down back around the house up another set of stairs with a heavy door and back in the house on crutches. I still did all of that to find the package was not even there anymore. They wouldn't let me report it missing until Monday saying maybe a neighbor got it.

JG,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Never seen a company go from absolute best in class customer service to absolute worst as fast as Amazon. Been shopping with the company since 1999. Used to be helpful by chat and would resolve any issues quickly and courteously and if they screwed up, compensate you for your wasted time/money. Now it is the complete opposite. Massive bureaucracy, miss guaranteed delivery dates and rudely lie about it all with no shame...then offer nothing for wasting your time and money. I've personally been super impressed with what Target has done with their online/curbside pickup experience and shop there as often as I can now. Walmart service is also atrocious but will even go there now before this once standard setting, now bottom dwelling joke of a company. "

Amy Buchanan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Second order from Amazon that has not been shipped. Free shipping and fulfillment from Amazon. One item has been sitting in my account for over 3 months and is not been shipped. I was not charged. Order I placed with free shipping of 6 items on October 18, 2024. I only received 1 item. The rest of the items are sitting there not being shipped. If they are out of stock when I ordered them, then remove them from the site and tell me they are out of stock. I partially paid my order with a $20 Amazon gift card and the remaining balance from my bank account. My bank account was not charged but they took my Amazon gift card and I have no items to show for it. It should not take months and weeks to receive items for free shipping. I have been a customer for a long time and only the last few months, i have had problems. I just recently had to cancel an order last month because the seller was not shipping. Amazon will not let me cancel the order from October 18th because it was free shipping. I made a complaint to bbb.org. I do not like that I cannot cancel and get my gift card back. I am no longer going to get free shipping where Amazon ships the order. I will only order from specific sellers that have a very high rating and are known to ship orders in a timely fashion or I will only order from sellers that I have ordered from before. Enough of free shipping and fulfillment from Amazon, they do not know what they are doing anymore. I am not using Amazon gift cards on free shipping and fulfillment from Amazon. I will use gift cards on sellers that have high ratings. Amazon on their own does not have my high rating anymore."

KMG,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I contacted Amazon customer service as there was a pricing error on their website. When I select the item it shows ¬£229, however when I scroll down to add it to the basket it displays ¬£249.99. After a difficult conversation with someone who has poor English on live chat, they first they tried to gaslight me by saying that's not the case and their website doesnt show that. Then when I provided a screenshot as proof they started telling lies... that the lower price is without tax, and the higher with tax. Firstly, prices on the UK website are displayed with tax included. Secondly, if that was the case then tax added at 20% would mean a total price of ¬£274.80. Amazon are misleading customers with their prices, then telling lies to cover up the reason why. Appalling service from staff representing a company of this scale."
Mario Rossi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought a laptop for almost 500 euros. Order confirmation email arrived.The order, already a few hours later, does not have an active link. It takes me back to my personal page, which indicates that I have NEVER placed any purchase orders.I spent hours and hours trying to contact them via chat (the desktop version on mobile is incomprehensible and I needed help from Amazon.it, who helped me but in the end I solved it myself, understanding the real display problem...).Order cancelled due to suspicious access to the account. It is not possible, I have always provided email, password and confirmation via SMS.Furthermore, NO ONE CONTACTED ME IN ANY WAY TO COMMUNICATE THE CANCELLATION OF THE ORDER.I could have noticed it days and days later.After making me wait a day, they tell me that the order has been cancelled and I have to enter a new one.Ridiculous.I try.Problems again. They do not accept my credit card to activate Amazon Prime. Tried with 4 different credit cards, all active.I contact support again. They tell me that yesterday's order was canceled by the seller (madness) and I write for over an hour with people who don't speak English (I'm a foreigner and my level of English is low but it's a thousand times better, apparently, than that of the operators who provide assistance for Amazon because they DON'T understand the problem and the sentences and answer one question out of three).They make up that the problem is with the bank that refuses payments (impossible, I work for this bank, the cards are active and I used them yesterday, among other things already on Amazon, and the bank didn't send me any notification).In the end they send me a link to a specific page for Amazon Prime, and by giving ok, and the registration happens directly (almost an hour to make them understand that was the problem). No one can explain the problem.I continue with the order and insert it. Everything seems fine. I go back to the chat to notify them and ask for confirmation.Nothing, the joke continues.The new operator says he also read all the previous conversations but he didn't understand anything. I suspect that all the operators are illiterate or have a serious problem understanding the text.Now he keeps telling me that my order was canceled when I see him. For 20 minutes I've been trying to explain to him that he's probably referring to the old order.It's ridiculous. Everyone talks about how great and good Amazon is but the service is ridiculous. Pathetic. Amazon.it is definitely managed much better.I will try to buy the computer in a local store because you are ridiculous and my time is precious.After all, you didn't even offer a discount.Just beautiful, USELESS, words of apology.For some reason, there is no record of the times of the messages sent, nor is it possible to have a copy.They do not want to leave traces of how ridiculous the assistance they provide is.Go dig the fields.SHAME ON YOU ridiculous."
–í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å –í–æ—Ä–æ–±–π–æ–≤,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Here‚Äôs an English version of your review, covering both incidents with Amazon. Feel free to adjust or add any specific details before posting.First Incident:The first time I ordered a space heater from Amazon, it arrived looking clearly used, with scratches and signs of wear. I had expected a new item, so it was very disappointing. Due to a language barrier and not understanding the return process well at the time, I ended up keeping it, but I felt let down by Amazon‚Äôs standards.Second Incident:Recently, I ordered a coffee machine, and the experience was even worse. Not only did it also arrive looking used, but the machine itself was cracked. I felt misled, especially since I waited several days for delivery, with Amazon constantly changing the expected delivery time. I even left work early one day because Amazon‚Äôs tracking showed my package was ‚Äúnext in line for delivery,‚Äù only for it to be rescheduled again without arriving.Overall Experience:Both of these incidents have made me question Amazon‚Äôs quality control and delivery reliability. Receiving used or damaged items sold as new is unacceptable, and the unpredictable delivery scheduling is incredibly frustrating, especially when it impacts my work and daily routine. I hope Amazon addresses these issues to ensure customers receive the quality and service they expect.This review should cover your experiences clearly and effectively! Let me know if you‚Äôd like further tweaks."
Kandis Moffitt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Let me start by saying until today I would say Amazon had good customer service ( even though I may have NOT liked the outcome). Today the Representative had me on hold alot but I figured she was checking to be sure to give me the correct information. I apparently ordered a product (HTVRont Permanent Vinyl) that was not the correct product. I needed the HTVRont heat transfer vinyl.  So I wanted to return the wrong item and get the correct item. The representative gave me the option of refund or replacement. I said replacement as the products cost the same amount. The rep placed me on hold AGAIN and the end result for the representative was that she was replacing the item with the EXACT same item that I was returning. When I brought it to her attention she said ‚Äú well that‚Äôs what you ordered ma‚Äôam‚Äù ok so why would I want you to send it to me AGAIN? She continued to say because that‚Äôs what you ordered.So after 33 minutes of my holding on I was going to get the EXACT same item. This DID NOT make sense so I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor was an additional 12 minute conversation that was a waste of my time. If the policy does not allow for replacement then it does not allow for replacement. The representative gave me the option of either a REFUND or REPLACEMENT.  I picked replacement but apparently Amazon doesn‚Äôt offer that. My end result was a refund being issued that will take 7-10 business days and I would need to make another investment and hope I get the correct item. AMAZON you should be ashamed!! I am a small business you are NOT. IF I am sending back an item for $31.99 and the correct item is $31.99 why is it so difficult for you to switch the items AS THE INITIAL REP had offered.     A total of 49 minutes of my life wasted and a multitude of excuses and apologies for POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Customer,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"I rarely have issues with buying anything on Amazon and vast majority of the time the item I get is pretty good. That's where I would differ from most people's complaints. I would say the biggest issue is that I think their service might be on the decline. I remember once upon a time I could order an item and usually get it next day, sometimes two days, but now I seem to have to wait more than that. What happens a lot now is that I'll order an item that says it will come tomorrow, just to get an email later saying it'll be delayed for another day or longer. Didn't used to be like that.

Tch√™ Ajudo - Consultoria,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I traveled to the United States and bought a tablet on Amazon. It was delivered to my hotel. On the first day, the tablet worked fine, but the next day it stopped working. It simply wouldn‚Äôt turn on anymore. The issue was that I had to return to Brazil the following day, as my flight was already scheduled. I went to an Amazon store to try to return it, but at that time, they couldn‚Äôt send it. Since I couldn‚Äôt wait due to my flight time, I had to come back to Brazil and bring the tablet with me. Once in Brazil, after five months, I managed to send it back at my own expense, but they say they didn‚Äôt receive the tablet (which is a lie because I have the delivery receipt with a signature). They have been making it difficult to get a refund for over a year now. I‚Äôve tried everything: email, chat, Amazon Brazil, but no one has resolved it."

Philip,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Most of us have probably bought something from Amazon, and from ordering, despatch, and delivery, everything has gone well.I also think that Customer Service works well, as long as you can get to SPEAK with someone, and they can help you, rather than relying on electronic communications.They usually answer your question, but the email says it has come from a mail-box that can't be replied to! Very helpful, NOT! So you go back and speak to them. They do seem to keep a good electronic paper-chase on the customer, so that, they quickly know what this issue is, and at which point it is, in terms of resolution, even though they have call-centres in South Africa, the Philippines, and elsewhere.Here's an outline of my latest dealings:Some years ago, I bought a couple of security torches which plug into a wall-holder, which keeps them charged. If the mains power fails, they light up and provide a helpful light, should this happen at night.One of them failed, and it was clear that the fault was not in the torch, but in the plug-holder, which charges the torch by induction.Sadly, because it was out of guarantee, nothing could be done, and I had to buy a replacement from Amazon.I still decided to replace like with like, so received a new torch + holder from the same distributor.I bought this in March this year (2024), and it also failed! So I got onto Amazon to organise a refund. Initially you contact the distributor/manufacturor, and they decide whether they want it back, and whether they'll refund it.In my case, they neither wanted it returned, and weren't going to refund me, even though it was still guaranteed.They dragged their heels, so Amazon filed an A-Z Guarantee Claim on my behalf, and the money is already back in the account I used to buy it with.Furthermore, one of the agents arranged for me to have a ¬£5 credit because of the poor treatment from the other company!So, I have now bought another torch/holder, which was a couple of pounds dearer than the original, but when I looked at my account, there was the ¬£5 credit, ready to go. I used this against the new torch, so not only should it be better, but it's still cheaper!Amazon's documentation is a little convoluted, and not 0verly user-friendly, but with the help of Byron (S Africa), Doris (Ghana) and Mark (Phllippines) everything was efficiently resolved, in a friendly and really polite manner. I couldn't fault anyone I spoke to, of Amazon itself.I will, though, mention that the manufacture of the particular torch unit that failed more than once, is 'AP TORCHES' - merchandise is not reliable in the longer time-scale, and their attitude to the customer leaves a lot to be desired! This is silly, because Amazon doesn't like companies, however large or small, that brings its name into disrepute."
ENTWISTLE,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,What is wrong with Amazon drivers? They tried to push after folding the edges through the mailbox ! Both lots that had 4K blurays in them.Whats really sad is that all they had to do was open the porch door (that was  unlocked) & leave on the shelf.The packaging is there to protect the product.

Tom Hand,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a book which was first sent back. Then I chose re-order it. Then a new invoice, but the invoice amount was zero. Then it was sent back ""undeliverable"". It apparently has not arrived back, so I cannot get a refund. The first book was shipped on Aug.11, the second on Sept. 7. It is now Nov. 1 and every time I click on an option of possible ways to solve this I go into a self-referring loop. There is no way to talk to a human. I would rate zero, if that was an option. I will now take a legal route to get my money back. The shipping co., ECMS global , is equally unreachable. As far as I can tell , it is merely an app."

Ariela,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon‚Äôs customer service isn‚Äôt just bad‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic nightmare crafted to wear you down. From endless chat loops with unhelpful responses to constant transfers that reset the conversation, they seem bent on making you give up on refunds or solutions. Representatives often struggle with clear communication, leading to repeated explanations that go absolutely nowhere.When an agent finally says they‚Äôre ‚Äúchecking,‚Äù you‚Äôre left in silence until the chat times out and auto-transfers you to someone new, where the whole mess starts again. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre betting that eventually, you‚Äôll just walk away frustrated.In the end, Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúservice‚Äù is a waste of time and patience. If you value straightforward support, skip Amazon and put your energy into finding companies that actually stand by their promises. Trust me‚Äîyou‚Äôll thank yourself."
Jack Clemens,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has become a haven for online retailer scamming. Often the item that you receive is a cheap version of the item pictured and described.

David J. Stewart,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I wrote a movie review in August of 2024 on Amazon. A few days later I received an insane notice from Amazon's Community Standards Department, falsely accusing me of using ""hate speech,"" and they threatened to terminate my account. They sent the notice three times. I had been a loyal customer for 20-years, making several hundred purchases.Here is the exact unedited movie review that I wrote back in August of 2024 about the 1990 movie, ""Lord Of The Flies"":RID: R2GHD7DFIXO1I1Title: A Waste Of MoneyText: ""This movie is just a group of small boys using foul language, acting to a horrible script, and it's as boring as can be. I literally threw the movie into the garbage pail after watching it. What a waste of money! It wasn't anything what I had expected. Don't waste your money. The title is very misleading in my humble opinion. I expected a classy science fiction movie, not the Little Rascals stuck on an island boring me to death.""Is that really ""hate speech""? Evidently some younger employee thought I was calling children ""little rascals"" (boy that sound hateful, huh?), but if you'll please notice, I capitalized the Word ""Little Rascals,"" in reference to the 1970's popular television series, ""The Little Rascals."" I wasn't using hate speech and I resent Amazon's horrible accusation against me as a 20-year customer, kindly said. Things only escalated after Amazon's employees threatened to terminate my account over this acceptable review, especially when I told them off in frustration. I told them where they could go, because I was understandably upset. I don't like being falsely accused of a crime.In response to my harsh outbursts in my emails to their abusive Community Standards idiots, they refused to reinstate my ability to write further reviews, and after two months of kindly apologizing and begging for their forgiveness (which they adamantly refused to do), I reluctantly terminated my account at Amazon. What horrible jerks!Here is the last message I received from Amazon's abusive staff:""Dear DavidMy name is Keyam and I work within Amazon Executive Customer Relations.We removed your posting permissions because your content violated our Community Guidelines and Conditions of Use.

Carol Curtis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a Foldable Rollator from Helavo, which was advertised as two-toned bronze and white with matching accessories. However, upon delivery, I received a silver and black model, which did not match the description shown in the image when choosing the colour of the item I selected on Amazon. This Item and the color two-toned bronze white Rollator does not exist the seller is obtaining property by deception and Amazon continues to allow the seller to advertise this deception on their website.  Despite filing a complaint, Amazon's only solution was to offer a return and full refund. This resolution is unsatisfactory to me, as the nature of online shopping did not allow for physical inspection prior to purchase. A full refund and return do not rectify the issue, as the seller misrepresented the item, which was not as described on the Amazon website. I believe the appropriate resolution is to replace the item with the one originally displayed on Amazon.    "
Vishal Jaynarayan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent order from Amazon, which has yet to be resolved despite multiple efforts on my end. I ordered cameras and Shilajit products (tracking number 9339589677038360991322), which were supposed to be delivered on 14 October 2024. However, the items never arrived, and every inquiry I make leads me in circles without any solution.After noticing the delivery delay, I reached out to the freight forwarder, who informed me that the package was delivered to a Post Office agent instead of their facility. They assured me I would receive a warehouse receipt once the package arrived at their location (HAB), but I have received no further information, leaving my items unaccounted for.To make matters worse, the USPS tracking information shows conflicting delivery dates ‚Äì one stating 21 October 2024 and another 22 October 2024 ‚Äì both indicating delivery to an agent. This discrepancy raises serious questions about the accuracy and handling of this shipment.When I contacted Amazon regarding this issue, I was told that since the package was sent to a freight forwarder, they could not process a refund or replacement. This response is extremely disappointing, considering the value of the items and the clear delivery inconsistencies. As a customer, I chose Amazon for its reputation for reliability and customer care, yet this experience has been far from satisfactory.Refunding or replacing these items is in Amazon‚Äôs best interest as it demonstrates a commitment to customer satisfaction and fosters long-term loyalty. The lack of resolution only adds frustration for customers relying on international shipping, which is already challenging enough without these additional complications.Please review this issue with urgency and provide a solution that reflects Amazon‚Äôs dedication to customer service. I look forward to a prompt response and a resolution to this frustrating situation."

H. Chappelle,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"They offer a great variety of products.  I live in a rural area with not many stores (there is just one gas station/store in the town I live in), and Amazon offers quite a bit.  The only problem I have with Amazon is that they do not let me review products anymore after I gave a good review of a health food product a few years ago.  The BBB was not able to do anything about it.  I used to sometimes get a few freebie products (not many, just a few) due to reviews and was one of the top reviewers for dog products.  Being on a budget, I appreciated being a top reviewer.  I still do not understand why they removed me from being a reviewer, their customer service staff could not tell me, and did not reinstate me."

On October 31st, I checked the tracking status, only to find the delivery attempt had been canceled on October 29th‚Äîsupposedly by me, though I never canceled it. After reaching out to Amazon and speaking with three different customer service agents, none could explain why the order was canceled. I was informed that the price had since increased and that I‚Äôd need to reorder the item at the new price and wait an additional 10 days for delivery. They promised a refund for the price difference once the item arrives, but I‚Äôm skeptical. This experience feels like a tactic to charge a higher price for an already-purchased item, especially since the product was already en route. I'm left without the product I need, no clear resolution, and no immediate refund. Very disappointed and frustrated by the lack of transparency and the expectation that I should reorder to resolve this issue."

Still waiting for update on that.I received a text message at 2 am today from both anazon and theur courier. Item delayed... No mention of which item. No apology, No explanation.I have an agreement with amazon. They pass responsibility onto another courier firm. That courier firm completely disregards tge time constraints.

I‚Äôve even been in the midst of a free series and suddenly it switches to ppv. More cost. Less service. Like every retailer that has apparently cornered the marketplace, it will give rise to competitors who deliver better service. Soon Amazon will be just another WalMart. "

This time it exceeded my imagination.  I've ordered a big delivery on Amazon Prime.Including a Samsung galaxy phone. I live in a sheltered housing , the delivery didnt arrive by 13:00 as promised. I was home ridden, as really needed a new phone.  I left specific instructions for delivery,  and added my neighbours details just in case.It appeared someone was trying to hack my account.

Then it seems suspicious they claimed the carrier made an attempt to deliver, and claimed,  he,wasn't provided with the password by me. It was a lie and alarming.Amazon promised the delivery will arr the next day.Again I was waiting all day.The deliver arrived after 19:00.I've asked the delivery guy to wait, as they were few items,  and wanted to make sure everything was delivered.

Interestingly, they didn't even bother to ask for details and have decided to reimburse Amazon. There's no Complaints channel on Amazon, shamefully they don't accept Resolver , and seems like they are a cartel who's above the law.  They are great with small issues,  and even then you depend on the mercy of their personnel.   But when it comes to a big purchase,  or an expensive item - you're consumers rights are at risk. They simply wave you off and exhaust you.  Don't buy from Amazon. They are above the law.And aren't even willing to be supervised. And I was a victim of a scam.

It sounded very wired so I didn't, and so thats how they make extra money, because I assume there are other people like me, which they don't feel confortable sending a photo id.just to get whats yours...(or just to pay for their mistakes, which I start to believe they are intentionally made...)So, zero stars for amazon."
Kristi B,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"For two orders in a row they have not been able to ship products. First one took almost a month for a refund and most recent order, they didn‚Äôt tell me the product was unavailable, that showed up after I placed my order. I tried to cancel my order and they say I cannot. I called Customer Service and they say I cannot and they can‚Äôt either so in otherwards, I will be charged for a product I will never receive. I have never been more disgusted with Amazon than I am at this point in time in fact when I get my money back and I pay off what I owe, I will never shop Amazon again. "
lisa ryan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give zero stars I would, notified 1 hour before delivery not enough time to get home, set to redelivery on the 31st October 5 days later, I check every morning about 9 to see if delivery day and time is updated no up dates this morning. I Had a call at 11.38 asking if I was home I wasn't he said he would Waite for 15 mins until I got back  I don't drive I use busses and I'd be about an hour, I said could you please re deliver when I'm in he said call me when you are in, I tried to call him back but his number didn't register. What a crap waste of space Amazon delivery system is. Notifications useless when they do decide to send them, delivery times and dates useless everything useless for a multi billion ¬£ company they could improve on their delivery system instead of cutting corners and giving less than an inadequate service, I really feel for the drivers, after this delivery I will not be buying off of Amazon again and I will be deleting my account, Amazon isn't always the best or cheapest site to buy from."

Neill Bird,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Account deactivated. BEWAREAccount deactivated. Email below from deactivation. Needless to say it's vague and there's no fact in it. The reason cannot possibly be legitimate. My account is reinstated but no reason given or apology. No human involvement it seems. So had I had a significant amount of Amazon devices, Alexa, Fire stick, TV, WiFi etc. ALL WOULD CEASE TO FUNCTION it seems. Buyer beware. I was demoted to being a non human. Makes you think.

Just think about it for a moment.The single Alexa installed at my grans ceased to function so no, drop in, no schedule for her music. She's very distressed.Time Friday to Sunday with no access. Email saying activated on Saturday did not result in access so a follow up email was needed.Trust Amazon again? I'd have to be insane to do so. Big order in progress you wouldn't even be able to contact them. Gift Credit on account, gone. It's happened.

Kim C. Saxvik,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrible shipping and support for orders to Norway. Delays and nobody at Amazon knows why or when it can be shipped. Even talked to supplier and they say when they got the stock up in Europe they say tha amazon says my Card is not accepting payment. Amazon says i should just wait. Highly unpredictable shopping experience. 2 month shipping for something that they say is ""In Stock"" is not good service."

David Ford,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am sick and tired of getting ""guaranteed"" delivery days that are not true. On several occasions Amazon will state that my item will arrive by 10PM on a certain day, and continue to state that until 11PM that day and then magically the delivery date will roll over. Why give false information to consumers knowing it can alter their purchasing decision to go with another company. Absolutely tired of expecting packages that state will arrive today and never do."
Elliot Percussion,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I called to ask when my item would be shipped and the representative tried to get me to cancel the order instead.  This was a disappointing interaction.  I purchased an item directly from Amazon Prime and was told I would need to contact the brand to make sure I would receive my item.  Amazon should be doing that work. Not me.  I was told that Amazon never contacts anyone including the brands it works with.  I guess Amazon doesn't have one individual who can personally make a phone call or send a message.  I was once a fan of Prime, but the customer service has clearly gone from 4/5 stars to 0/5 stars with a horribly obtuse AI and frustrating customer ""service.""  "
S S,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We have become dependent on Amazon, and they have created a market for themselves with their convenience, easy returns, and variety of products. However, I am going to back away from new orders, Cancel my subscription orders and when my Prime Membership is due, I will cancel that as well. I am so annoyed and disheartened that Jeff Bezos is afraid of Donald Trump and therefore refused to allow the Washington Post to endorse Kamala Harris in this upcoming election. We all know that Trump is trouble. Billionaires should not be allowed to buy News media outlets, such as Elon Musk, the other coward who owns the LOS ANGELES times and now Jeff Bezos. They all say they support freedom of speech, supposedly except when they think it is gonna hurt their bottom line and their own pocketbook. I am sure at least for Jeff Bezos that he doesn‚Äôt really support Trump, but he is too much of a coward to come out and say that. Obviously Elon Musk supports Trump because he wants all those government contracts, continued security clearance  and he wants to reduce any type of regulation for his businesses. I hope others will join me in this boycott. But that is a personal decision."
Mark Anderson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"What has happened to Amazon's Prime delivery service?I have had issues with Amazon's delivery service for over 12 months now. I only live 12 miles from their huge delivery hub in Theale but again and again delivery schedules are not kept. Next day delivery becoming 3+ days.And what makes this so much worse are the lies! ""Attemped delivery"" when our security camera show that they were never here, or tonight's message ""couldnt gain access to front door"" when in fact the delivery was to a 24 hour Amazon Locker - there is NO fron door. Thought that delivering to an Amazon locker might increase the chance of actually receiving an item. I was wrong! Still unable (or unwilling) to deliver.Contacting customer services is an absolute waste of time. Can't think why I keep my Prime membership.To be lied to on such a regular basis can only reflect the absolute contempt that Amazon has for its customers. Amazon's overall service has taken a great dive over the past 12 months."

Angela Davis Johnson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Borders are constantly late.Even though they are reporting the shipping and delivery dates. My packages are not delivered on the date that it says. I can even check the morning of the day. That my packages are supposed to be delivered, and it still reports a delivery date that day until the next day. They change it and state that they haven't even shipped it yet, but yet my card has been charged for the purchase. The last 2 times this has happened, I've gone to Walmart.com ordered the same thing and got the package before I could even get it delivered from, Amazon. My packages are ending up not being delivered for almost 2 weeks after I ordered them. But i'm not having this same issue with other companies. I do not plan to shop Amazon because i'm tired of waiting two weeks for a delivery and having them.Charge my card well before they've even shipped! Anymore, amazon is unable to deliver when they say they will causing projects for me to be late. On this review, it asks the date of the incident.However, this has happened multiple times for me!"
Gary Byrne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon driver damage property disgraceful customer care don't care 
NS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There have been several instances of Amazon not delivering my items to the correct address. Todays debacle has taken place by an item being delivered when I have previously asked for the driver to call me and I will collect it; instead I have received a picture of my order in between two bins,  bins which are not at my address I may add.The whole process of me ordering an item for next day delivery often turns into three or four days. Why am I paying for Amazon Prime which is now ¬£110 annually then paying again for another delivery charge to have the drivers not to follow the instructions? Not to mention that I have already paid for a Prime to then have to pay another fee to listen to music. The whole service would be better known as a scam. "
D Ham,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give this company a zero, I would.  I just went through the process of trying to talk with a customer service representative, and when I finally got a hold of a person, they didn't like the fact that I had a complaint that I wanted to express before requesting help with an issue.  They hung up on me.  When I tried to phone back, the automated service rejected me with the explanation that only legitimate concerns will be addressed!  So, I started to search on the Internet for a way to make a complaint...I couldn't find one.  Clearly, Amazon has a strong influence over Google.  I find I can write a review about most companies on Google, but not Amazon.  As I began to do some digging, I came across quite a few legitimate news articles about Amazon 'customer service' and how terrible it is as soon as you deviate away from simple returns or questions that fit into their automated responses.  I also came across some interesting articles about their fake product reviews, which makes sense to me, as we have purchased a number of products over the years that were garbage, but yet had positive reviews.  This is an evil company, that absolutely does not have customer service, will only post real reviews they deem satisfactory for the company image and boosting sales, and clearly spend a lot of time and money ensuring their company image is not tarnished.  I will go back to using brick and mortar businesses as much as possible now that I know what Amazon is really about.  Like so many things in our society, once you start to peel back the veneer you see what is really underneath? "

I can see they don't care how you feel either.Hate they've gotten more strict with their return policy stating item must be in new condition when returned. Um, no. Sometimes you have to try an item out to see if it even works. If it's gently used oh well get over it. Also, there's plenty of times I get damaged items from them. I hate their customer service. 1 min I get told I don't have to send something back for a refund, then when I reach back out bc I didn't get the refund, the next agent tells me no I have to send item back.

There is competition is Walmart, but little, believe me, the in-house brands of Amazon Basics will give startling and shocking quality at steeply affordable prices. I am writer, with two kids, could never afford much of Marks and Spencer beyond the season end sales, then came this. And yes, it has excellent Kindle ecosystem and a new Indian Kindle Fire ecosystem. True to spirit love of consumers, going through a patch in local economy here due to protests, which is simply pain of change.

After many attempts, I was able to finally talk to an actual person who told me the delivery driver would try again today. He also told me that the driver would call me. I'm so disappointed that my grandson will cry himself to sleep tonight. What is the point of paying for Amazon Prime when items are not delivered when they say they will be?

nik.coco,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been a member of Amazon since 2001. For the most part I have been a satisfied customer. However, I must say the last few years, I have had a few ups & downs with them. To save time, I will only mention my most recent issue with them. I placed an order on 10/18/24 for a baby-shower gift which I ordered 7 items in total. Since I am a Prime member, it was originally scheduled to arrive on Sunday 10/20/24. To be fair I did receive at least 5 of those items before the baby shower which was that Thursday 10/24/24. I'm upset because I called Amazon on Tuesday 10/22 & Wednesday 10/23 because I did not receive my other two items and I started to worry the remaining two gifts wouldn't arrive in time for the shower. All of the items I selected are Prime eligible which is why I chose them to begin with. Amazon has both items listed as ""In Stock"" on their website yet one of those items ended up being Cancelled and the other arrived a day late after the shower so I couldn't include it with the rest of the other gifts. I'm upset because the Rep said they would have the gifts to arrive no later than that Wednesday (day before the shower) which I was 100% for. Good customer service would have suggested a similar item or I would have gladly tried another store if I wasn't told it would arrive by Wednesday. That's why I'm pissed. In any other time, they ask you to fill out a customer survey on how they did, but wouldn't you know it, I was never asked on either of the two days I spoke to customer service if i could take a satisfaction survey. Gee, I wonder why?"

Together with my husband we've been one of the first international customers of amazon and mostly satisfied, I can't believe that this is how they choose to show their growth with Amazon's Prime users in 2024.So disappointing."

Prof Lady Elodie D'Estrange,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to be very happy with my deliveries, however over the past 2 months my parcels are left in front of my door. I am a wheelchair user so it is difficult to pick parcels up from the floor and when I have been out and there are a pile of parcels, I can't access my own home! I leave super clear delivery instructions, but no one bothers with those. I have in total complaint 4 times about this, but nothing is being done about it. It's disgraceful. "

Anne-Marie Furlong,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,On Sunday 22nd September at 13.47 the Amazon driver delivered a package and stole my Spaniel. Amazon have refused to take any responsibility and help the police in any shape or form. This is not a one off occurrence and they are letting their drivers get away with it.

I have written 3 very honest reviews about my experiences. Not all bad. A lot are good. But bad service people deserve to know about then make up their own mind whether they shop with that company. What is the point of only posting 5* reviews.

They tried to take my washing machines back, refusing to leave my house, by the end I was screaming for them to leave. Luckily a neighbour came to see what was happening and they left.I contacted Amazon with no joy, I couldn‚Äôt complain to a manager, the whole experience was really distressing.I will never use this company again "

I pay for prime so next day to be exact.. and yet I have spent two days when the driver is nearby .. waiting in my garden just for the P**ck to drive on by and say attempted delivery.. customer has not responded etc‚Ä¶ maybe if the lazy Pr**ks you employed actually got out of their vans and did their jobs I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining .

VH og MH,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Customer phone support is truly bad: After changing mobile number I could not log on because the site wanted a code from an SMS. Only way to get in contact with Amazon is by calling their customer service. I did that and informed the customer service agent that I haven't used it for some years and changed mobile number since, and now I was stuck. Then she asks me to name some of the items I have bought in the past 3 months :-) NONE :-) The customer service agent was unaware of how a phone number is structured into a country code and phone number and ended up sending verification messages to a wrong number in the US, and not my country. When we finally - after 15 minutes - got through the practicalities of sending and receiving text messages, the customer service agent could not use that anyway to change my mobile number on my profile and had to ask a 2nd level supporter whom I was relayed to. The 2nd level support wanted to check some things and asked me to wait... 5 minutes after the line was hung up. 32 minutes of international call for nothing - not even a follow-up mail, although they know my email and also knew it worked (because I approved their support action through an email they sent me). This is really bad.. and quite frankly not very scalable having to call Amazon to change mobile number. I guess people do change mobile from time to time without remembering to change the Amazon account... Now, after 23 years or so (during an era where customer satisfaction was #1 theme at Amazon), I will have to recreate my account with a different email and then at least I will not have to waste time on a poor service desk experience. Amazon: 1) improve / modernize your selfservice platform for login and 2) please improve basic maintenance capabilities among your support staff. PS: The agent was as such friendly and all that, just not very useful. "

Jeff Sux,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been an Amazon prime member for more than 10 years and have been shocked by the company‚Äôs behavior. A partial list related to my shopping experience.1.

Requiring returns to go through the seller. Now the sellers have my data. Thanks Amazon.5. Poor product quality.6. Setting up the customer interface for returns to minimize returns. For instance, make sure you click on refund to original payment otherwise you will not get a refund to your credit card.7. Items that never show up even though they have ‚Äúshipped‚Äù.I hope Walmart+ gets its act together. I‚Äôd rather shop there at this point."

David Smith,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has really gone downhill. They will scam you out of your money if given the opportunity! Their customer service is absolutely nonexistent! I've been using them for many years and at the point to where I've decided to quit using them. Too many problems with orders not arriving too many problems with returns too many problems trying to get my money back when I send returns. Just a constant problem anymore! I recently made a return to Amazon they did not issue a refund. When I contacted Amazon they said it had been over 30 days so they were no longer able to process it because it was not scanned in correctly by AMAZON! I don't work for Amazon why am I being held accountable for it?? 
Patrick Barnaby,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The Reviews for Amazon maybe bad here but I worked for Amazon for 4 years so I know how things worked. No Company is perfect. I have had items missing or Stolen about twice from Amazon and I've had an order Stolen from SAMSUNG. I've given Amazon 5 Stars because comparerd to every other Company Amazon has the best Customer Service and they make everything quick and easy. You can't beat Amazon for spead of Delivery and Customer Service. As a previous employer I wish I didn't sell my blue Badge. Mr Jeff Bezo if you somehow manage to read this message I'll sell you back the Blue Badge and you can reemploye me. Every Company should take note of how Amazon are so quick on Delivery and Customer Service.
Mr S Miller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Why does Amazon allow sellers to say their items ‚Äúcountry of origin‚Äù is in the UK yet when postage details arrive they are in China. I ordered a T-shirt from Amazon specifically because it stated on the seller page the seller was in the UK. Why are Amazon allowing sellers to send items across the world deliberately misleading customers and killing our planet. Do they not care about the damage this kind of rogue trading is doing to our environment. Shame on you Amazon. Never buying from you again!!

Deborah ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I complained to Amazon (my husband saw an Amazon delivery person jump out of his van and put a parcel on top of the village post box) and they said they would get back to me, over a week later they didn't so I have just been on their online chat.  I clearly stated in the first chat the type of item that was left on top of the village Royal mail post box as it turned out to me my parcel, and the current customer service person (Ram) said they read my initial complaint which included the details of the original item. I was past to another person (Jamit) who again asked me to wait while they read my initial complaint, they then asked me if the item was something completely different.  At this point I thought it's not worth my blood pressure, please someone start a company like Amazon but call it, We Care About Customers, if they did they would make a mint.  Getting so sick of Amazon.  They always ask us to score the chat but that's always before its been resolved so it guilts you into scoring good in case they read it and if its bad they do nothing.  Amazon used to be great and we all thought it was brilliant when it first started but now everyone moans about how rubbish it is. "
Jack Koehler,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I would like to raise a serious concern regarding the use of Chinese companies based in Hong Kong or China and how this is being used to bypass the EU's warranty regulations. As a consumer, you are not protected by the warranty you would normally be entitled to within the EU. This is a disappointing and unacceptable practice that feels like an attempt to avoid responsibility towards customers. It is highly problematic and comes across as outright fraud. My experience with amazon.de in this context has been extremely negative."
Lisa Scott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So I ordered a pair of boots sept 24 for over $200. It is now oct 24 and I have still not received the money back when I shipped them back promptly. Estimated date of refund keeps getting pushed back farther and farther and now it says November 1. Absolute untrustworthy company. With all the money they make you would think they‚Äôd be able to give you your money back but no, they said my package is not a priority because it‚Äôs a big ticket item. Only small packages are priorities. So now my credit card is getting charged interest on top of it and I needed my money back because I lost half my income. So thank you Amazon for screwing me. I Should have known better, they did the same thing to my boyfriend with a Tommy Hilfiger jacket. But I thought because it was from Zappos on Amazon, I would get my money back right away. But no, not at all. And Zappos cannot help do anything about it. This is not one of their expedited Items because it is More expensive. So BEWARE when ordering on Amazon!! And also most of the stuff they sell on there that is small items they sell exactly the same thing on Temu. I have purchased so many items on Temu. It is very trustworthy company they give you your money back fast and they have never failed me. But all those items are people are buying the stuff off Temu and selling them on Amazon for more money so beware about that too. "
Janet ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The item was delivered by throwing it over the hedge where it lay in the garden overnight. There was no attempt to ring the doorbell and since the package lay in the rain overnight it was soaked. I attempted to give a review but Amazon refused to print it. The mode of delivery is unimportant to them.
Bernard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Was shopping for herbs and supplements.  Amazon sometimes has the best price and sometimes not.  One I found on Amazon priced more than 200% of the companies website price, so be ware.  Trying to price Puritan's Pride Tumeric 800mg, 200 caps.  One listing and when you go to it, there is no price listed.  How can one post and how can Amazon allow an add to go up and not price it?  How many people did this go through and no one caught it.Now it gets worse.  Try to find a phone number to them???  Half hour later and find a number and get a foreigner that absolutely not only knew noting but was incapable of even being able to pull it up herself; I had to spoon feed her four times; then she would do noting; never made a single attempt.Like the world, Amazon gets worse every time I go to their website where their search engine is worse each time to."

Rather than replace it, they made me wait whilst it was sent off for ‚Äòrepair‚Äô. The repair people said a part needed to be ordered. Over a month later I received a blender that wasn‚Äôt the one I sent them. It had a big scratch in the dial which wasn‚Äôt present when I sent it. Amazon asked me to return which I did but I had to chase the refund, which they eventually provided. About a month later the blender turned up again at my door with the repair address on it. The repair dept had refused the return which is why Amazon had taken ages to refund me. I emailed the repair department and they said they sent it back because they thought it was a failed delivery from me, whatever that means. They basically tried to refuse the return so it looked like I hadn‚Äôt returned it and wouldn‚Äôt get my refund. I don‚Äôt know if this was deliberate or they are just very incompetent!"
Madswede,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Been a customer with Amazon since 2000 and suffice to say I have had my fair share of issues over the years with everything from late shipments to mishandled packages. Every time I reached out a resolution was made and my faith and trust in Amazon continued.That all changed with a very straightforward order that was placed on Oct 14th with the 2 day prime shipping and eta date which was slated for 2 day delivery. At no point did this say it was shipped by a 3rd party it was shipped and sold by Amazon.The order after the 2 day date came and went went to an ""uh-oh sorry"" page that the order was delayed, and to wait. The order was somewhat time sensitive and no further info was ever given to me, and I could have happily canceled and purchased it locally however...I first tried to cancel the order, and was given an email saying the order failed to be canceled.I reached out to customer service to ask for an update on the cancellation and was told that a ""shipper update would get the item out in 24 hours"" Well 24 hours came and went and the item was still delayed. I tried to cancel it again via their app, and again was told it's not possible.I contacted customer service again and this time I was told that I would get a refund for the item, and that the item has not shipped but if it did, I could keep it? I asked to have the order canceled and was told that it would be done and I would be given a refund back on an an amazon gift card.That never happened, the order was not canceled, as the Amazon rep said to me, nor was the refund issued.I then tried to cancel it again a day later, and again it was not able to be canceled, so then I reached out again to speak with a customer service rep. This rep told me a completely different story after I stated that the previous rep flat out lied to me and I stated I had the chat logs and they could check for themselves, they did not bother. Instead they told me that the item was delayed due to the location of the item and how they calculated shipping. I could get the item cancelled however now and have a refund made back to my card. I said yes please, and then was told it was done.Only it was not done. The order still remained, and my card was still charged and no refund ever given.I then reached out to Jeff Bezos's email to get someone hopefully with more authority to help. This turned into an eye opening moment for me personally as I explained the above, and all that was said was from Mydell B of Amazon.com on behalf of Andy Jassy the current CEO.""The item is already on its way to you and you can refuse delivery or request a return once the item arrives."" That was it, so it was on the customer who tried the most to make things right, to now spend time, gas, and energy to return an item that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days, instead it took 9 days in total.I replied and explained again that they opted to disregard the behavior of their customer service reps stating one thing and never following through, which was a flat out lie. The response was now from Diego saying ""the order shipped on Oct 21st and there is no tracking number for this shipment"". No comments on the lying or misinformation or fact that nobody could or would cancel my order, despite my cancellation occurring well beyond the actual ship date of Oct 21st!I got another response from Carlos M saying ""We value your feedback and realize your experience reflects on our company as a whole.""My response after was to state that why was I not able to cancel my order between Oct 14th and the 21st if the order never even shipped out during that time, and why was it ok for your reps to tell me they would issue a refund and cancel the order but never did?Flat out lies and deception with zero lack of ownership at the leadership levelnow and I am truly disappointed in Amazon and how they handled this."
customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought an item on 10/17 from Amazon.com.  The item failed to arrive so I called to cancel the order.  Amazon refused to cancel, refused to refund and refused to give an ETA for the product.  Finally, 4 days later, a Supervisor promised the order was cancelled and I'd get my funds back.  Day 5, I find a second charge to my debit card for the same product.  I made a deal with Amazon and bought a product to be delivery on 10/18.  Because they treated me so badly, I not longer want the item and I'm cancelling my Amazon Prime also.  They made sure I knew they do not care."

Paul Mcclaskin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There's two reasons why I will never order from Amazon again! 1. The delivery drivers are the most unprofessional, ignorant as*****s I've ever dealt with. I wasn't home when the delivery came because I WORK!!!! So when it came and he phoned I said I wasn't home and to drop it back at the depot and I will pick it up there. He hung up on me then proceeded to drop it off in the middle of my lobby where ANYONE could have helped themselves. That infuriated me!!!! No excuse, amazon is one hundred percent responsible for my deliveries getting to me.2. Too many products I see have an open box policy which means you can't open the product to even see if it's the right product, is it damaged, is it all there. So if you open it there's no refund. Since I started seeing that I don't order those products but then I'm spending more time searching for a company that stands behind its product To me that says that as a company they let just anyone on their site to sell with no control over customer getting what they want then have to deal with drivers who don't give (too hoots, not the words I chose but when customers are infuriated they should be able to put the words they feel) Leaving this review then heading over to my account to delete it and remove all debit and credit info. See u later Amazon."

This practice of outsourcing and keeping us Americans running around in circles in a torture box of confusion and not being able to get anything done needs to be stopped. Forget Amazon. I'll go buy stuff in store to avoid the headache or go to a Target website or Walmart even. Americans take your lives back. We know this isn't right. I did not scream or swear at them, I told them their English was undecipherable. Instead of taking responsibility for their poor skillset and doing a bad job, while I was helpless to their inability, they threatened to remove MY account instead. Americans need to start boycotting these companies that think they can evade doing their jobs by using English as second language students and automation. This needs to be illegal now. "

Igor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is disaster! I have not received the item I ordered as it was returned by the carrier as damaged. To get a refund, they ask to submit an Incident Report where I have to mention the tracking number. This tracking number does not exist and they send me to the company I have no clue who they are. Amazon say then no refund as my incident report is incomplete. It was not my fault on what happened but they do not care."
Mr Alan Ross,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The Amazon delivery van backed into my new car, which was parked in the driveway. The incident was recorded on CCTV. The driver did not give me his insurance details instead he gave me a number to call. Turns out he works for a company called Edsco who drive for Amazon. Phoned Edsco but to date have no insurance details. My insurance company were less than helpful but that‚Äôs another story. Amazon should be more careful who they employ as drivers, not only are they stupid but dangerous at best."

Contacted Amazon customer service rep Achin via chat on 09/16/24 & he indicated that a refund would be issued & that I can keep the device. please see attached screen shots of the chat with Achin that clearly demonstrate I was deceived but you will say misinformed.On 9/18/24 I again contacted Amazon CS via chat & spoke with Majin because I was leaving the country in a few days & wanted to ensure all was in order especially because of the unusual response I got from Achin. This is the rep that referred my concern to you. Majin reviewed the previous chats but informed me that I must return the ipad to obtain a refund. I protested because I was willing to work around the device malfunctions if I could keep it for free & now I do not have enough time remaining in the country to order a replacement. I was extremely agitated with the fact that a duly authorized Amazon rep lied to me using your communication network & added that I wanted follow up comms with a supervisor & here we are now.After that chat, I used your app for the return process but was restricted to only UPS pick up (thanx for that too when drop off is confirmable & simple).More confusion when the UPS driver showed up with 2 return labels but I only had 1 item.Returned package with 1 & kept the other label..Now a week later, my refund is pending receipt of the item that was shipped.......See attachment named 09.28.24 amazon return follow up email & 09.28.24 amazon be patient while we stall response..I would like my refund promptly issued after this nightmare of an experience with amazon.I have been a loyal satisfied customer for years & could have simply returned (via drop off) the defective ipad ordered a replacement with plenty of delivery time if I was not misled by your employee."

yudit llopis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought a chair on Amazon. After three weeks of waiting for it, I asked for my money back and the employee who helped me told me to call USPS and cancel the service that Amazon had requested with the transportation, since Amazon was not going to cancel or refund my money because the carrier already had the product, so I had to wait for it to show up, if it ever showed up. When I asked to speak to her superior, the person who was helping me in customer service aggressively made it clear to me that her superior was not going to go over her, nor suggest anything different to me and that I did not need to speak to him, and immediately began to use an excessively aggressive tone of voice. I truly believe this is one of the worst experiences I have had as a customer and it makes me very sad to see how Amazon's service and quality has declined to the point of not even wanting to give you your money back and asking you to do their job."
S.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Their customer service seems to be getting worse. I have ordered an expensive brand new camera lens, but the item has come in an open box / unsealed. Not the first time either, unfortunately.I needed the lens for a last minute shoot, hence why I ordered it from them instead of getting it from my usual shop.I spent about an hour talking to them, and I ended up talking to 6 different people and having to explain the same thing every time. They would just transfer me to someone else or disappear from the chat. One of them was also really rude and with an attitude, didn't even apologize when I explained what had happened, not even a sorry and it seemed I was bothering him. Another one told me to just use the item and return it afterwards. Is that what they are suggesting to their customers, then? And then they sell the item as brand new to someone else, like me?In the end, the only option they gave me was to just return the lens and for me to reorder, even though I would not get it in time for my shoot. I asked if at least I could get a discounted price as the item was open box instead of brand new, but no, apparently they don't do that anymore. I had a similar problem in the past and they ended up giving me a discount so that I could keep the item. All in all, this is the last time I buy anything expensive on Amazon. Mind you, not one of the most expensive lenses out there, but still I paid something around $1000, so you would expect a bit of a better service. "

I called on October 21st and they said they had to look into the matter some more. I tried asking when I was expected to get my package.

I suspect this password system is leading drivers to ignore the scheduled time and come back on a day when they don't have to ask for the pw.  The supplier only seems to supply through Amazon, so if I get nothing tomorrow, I'll be letting them know w that they need another channel."

Paul,Rated 1 out of 5 stars," Brought what Amazon call a renewed Computer. The Company I bought it from seemed to be supported by and recommend by them. The computer is advertised as a windows 11, Renewed and as being a 2022 Model. When I received the computer it had a sound Issue when using YouTube but this seemed common and at the time I thought it was fixed. The computer is a present, so was out away until a couple of days ago when I got it out just to check is was all updated and ready to use by my son. As soon as I turned it on it was slow so I started windows up date. This took a while but eventually it came up with the message that this computer is not compatible with windows 11. I couldn't understand because it has windows 11 on it? I tried several times but the same problem. I went to the dell site and it was then that I found out it was an old pre 2020 windows 10 model. After spending hours trying to update all the drivers and chip sets I tried to update windows 11 again, But same message. This Computer is not compatible.I have taken the computer into a shop and they have told me it's an Old windows 10 that someone has Programmed, He told me how but it went over my head, to accept win 11. So really it's a hack job of some kind. I have tried contacting Amazon who send me.round in circles and I end up back at the Company that Amazon Now refer to as a third Party vendor, who haven't gotten back to me. Amazons delivery service has become an unreliable Nightmare in the past 3 years or so, getting steadily worse, But at least you could normally contact someone even if it was a Bot, but now even that seems to much to expect. They stick adverts on their shows that quite frankly are so old we've all seen them, you have to pay to watch anything remotely new, and Thier core service of delivering Goods has become so bad some Previously really bad delivery services seem like gold standard in comparison and they change a monthly fee for that, and Alexa is a well known listening app. I have literally no choice but to cancel them because otherwise I'm the stupid one. And anyone who uses Amazon can expect to suffer the same consequences because I can't find anyone who isn't just a little bit fed up with the substandard service they now provide. And when Amazon gives you their word, It has become worthless."

I‚Äôve tried this about 3 times over past 15 years.  This time I bought a weighing scales which I was pleased with. Three weeks later I received a letter with Amazon logos all over it saying I had been awarded a ¬£20 voucher. On closer reading it told me all I had to do was leave a 5* review about my scales, take a screen shot and send it to them, then they would issue the ¬£20 voucher. I was rattled with this as I will not be bought to leave a good review. It makes a mockery of how true & honest reviews are. So I put a 1* on the review and explained. Surprise surprise Amazon will not publish it as it breaks their community guidelines. How I don‚Äôt know!! This time they won‚Äôt even allow me to edit it, they have totally blocked me from reviewing this order.

C. Hinkson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bait and switch product, sale managed by Amazon, not a third party seller. Even so, no option for customer service resolution.I ordered some unique instant oatmeal. It was supposed to come in 6 bags, 5 packets in each bag. Delivery came, picture taken by driver. I open the package and it's one bag with 5 packets. It cost $35.  While I acknowledge it is expensive to begin with for instant oatmeal, costing more than $1 each at the price, nobody in their right mind would pay $7 per instant oatmeal packet. Who am I, Lucille Bluth? Anyway, I assumed this was a warehouse mistake. Perhaps the 6 bags were packaged in a box and the whole box was supposed to ship- no big deal, mistakes happen. Well, in trying to resolve through the automated customer service tree, I identified the order I had an issue with, and was told that my product was not eligible for return. What? I'm not trying to return, I'm trying to get the other 5 bags of oatmeal, as advertised (or a pro-rated refund). I realized I needed to talk to a real human because their automated online system did not understand the nuance of the situation. I could not find a phone number, I could not find a chat agent. Eventually, I googled for a number. When I called, I was greeted with an outdated automated system. The system was clever enough to correctly guess that I was calling about the oatmeal, and I confirmed this was true. Then, the automated system told me the item was not eligible for return. Again, this is not the issue. The issue is the (accidental?) theft by not providing what was advertised and being (seemingly) unable to offer any remedy.They are too wealthy a company to pocket 30 of my dollars. I'll be starting a small court mediation if I cannot find a way to resolve this with them directly, in addition to stopping business. I understand that this won't impact them in the grand scheme of things, but it's unacceptable to be that large an organization and to remove the entire customer service department in favor of inept automation, with no clear remedy for situations computer programs can't handle.

Since July, they have delivered to me at least 5 orders that were not accurate- as in, I received products I didn't order. How does this continue to happen? Why is this happening, after all this time? Is this the new norm? I'm disappointed. I called their customer service line all to have the inexperienced agent offer to fill out a form and have someone get in contact with me within 24 to 48 business hours. Get it together Amazon. "

Wayne Drouillard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have amazon prime have for years .I always get my stuff in 1 to 2 days . Now when I order they are showing 7 to 10 days I had a friend look on his prime for the exact same item and seller and he will get in one day same postal code every item we look at is the same. I called customer service they said yes that's normal maybe out of stock when I order I told them we are standing side by side and every item shows 1 or 2 day shipping mine shows 7 or more days if I go on without signing in I have the same delivery dates as I do signed into my prime account  the lady said yes that is normal.  I asked to speak to someone smarter but they said managers don't answer phones . So I guess we buy a yearly subscription for nothing they say 1 to 2 day shipping with prime and absolutely not one thing I look at comes in in less than 7 days .that is false advertisement when  I live right by Windsor 5 min away from where everything is shipped to . Everything I have ordered for years has come in  in 1 or 2 days I hope someone starts class action lawsuit on them I'm sure I'm not the only one 
Joseph Starbuck,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a smart colour TV on 15 Oct. with delivery confirmed for 18 Oct.  By late afternoon of delivery day tracking info indicated the item was not out for delivery, so I contacted Amazon's customer support.  I was assured the delivery would definitely be made before 9 pm.  As the day went on with no delivery I contacted Amazon twice again, they again insisted delivery would definitely arrive by 9 pm.The deadline came and went.  Reference to my Amazon account now indicated a revised delivery date of 21st of Oct - 3 days later than promised.Contacted Amazon's support who were absolutely useless, offering insincere, mechanical apologies and waffle.  I cancelled the order and asked for a refund to be issued asap.  Was told the refund could take weeks because they have to get the item returned to them (when the item never even left Amazon!), process the return then start a refund process which alone takes 3 to 5 days.Though the order cancellation came about due entirely to Amazon's own poor service - failure to deliver, staff lying, etc. - Amazon refuses to commit to remedy their poor service promptly by refunding my money by a specified date.  Requests to speak with a supervisor or manager were rejected out of hand."

Consumer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wrong product sent refund taking ages 
Miss NJ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 2 items from same company. Both in stock & paid extra for BOTH to be delivered next day. Upon checking order which I specifically chose as we're both in UK - It's 2 different suppliers & one stated its from outside UK so won't be here until November.  Employ the thickest drivers they can find. Driver failed to 1. Knock at my address despite me taking half a day off to receive. 2. Failed to obtain any signature pr photographic proof of delivery. 3. Stated item handed to me which is a total lie. 4. Due to nature of item being 18+ it required ID & a signature which they didnt get. Should face repercussions & lose their job for being incompetent. It won't be the first theyve done this . Warrants sacking. Disgraceful courier service. I will never use again.
ROBERT GASCOIGNE,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Like most of the other people on here I can only report that the customer service at amazon are a complete joke.

Su W,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This review is for leaving fake sellers on their website. Ordered a body shop item from the seller BE REBELLION USA. When you click on the body shop link above the item listing, it all looks legit, as it takes you to the Body Shop website. However, the people who sent it out are BE REBELLION USA. The item that arrived took 3 weeks, likely from China (nothing against that, just that the Body Shop is not a Chinese company), and was clearly fake. The bottle was oval shaped, nothing like the pictures on the website and looked like water, not oil.When I contacted the seller about it, no response and of course I was not allowed a refund. I called Amazon and told them about the counterfeit product. Weirdly they immediately confirmed that this was indeed fake. I hadn't sent photos or anything. Which makes me think they know this seller sells fake products. They then sent a message to the seller to initiate my refund, which was great, but I'd much rather have this item and seller removed from Amazon instead of getting my $20 back.On top of that, my review which stated that the item was fake and that the seller was shipping out counterfeit products (this apparently violated the terms) was not allowed to be posted. It looks to me that this is all a scheme to sell cheap fakes for profit and Amazon is happy about their returns.Please y'all go the extra mile and report these things to Amazon directly, even if it takes a phone call. We need to push back on these things or else services for us will dwindle even more."

Gabriele,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that I've been using Amazon Italy intensively for more than 10 years without any problems. Last month however my credit card expired. After an initial payment was denied, I realized what the problem was, activated the new card on my bank, and updated the info on Amazon. It seemed ok, orders were accepted, but after about 30 minutes they were suspended (except for one that mysteriously went was delivered). Amazon claimed my bank was refusing payments, but my bank, Fineco, stated that the card was fine and that it was Amazon that for some bug was billing the expired card. I assume my bank is right because I've been using the renewed credit card with all other vendors without any issues. I spoke with the Amazon service centers many times, tried doing what they suggested i.e. including removing and reinstalling the card. Each time orders were accepted but after about 30 minutes they would be suspended. I gave up, removed the card inserted another card, managed to order a couple of items that were delivered, but then cards were removed by Amazon, I reinserted them and finally account was suspended (again also other card works fine with all other vendors). I called twice after that the service center asking what the problem was and what I had to do and they said at their level they could not help me but I would be contacted within a couple of days by the ""team that suspended my account"". This unfortunately was not the case, weeks have gone by since the problems started I haven't been contacted and cannot use my account. It seems that assistance works fine with problems that can be solved by call center using their algorithms but when it goes beyond that, at least in my case, there appears to be a major lack of organization.

Z Jovanovic,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Customer service has deteriorated so much; they promise to solve your issues- it never happens. Or they just transfer you over to the next agent ad nauseum!‚ñ∂Ô∏èLet me explain and give you some background: A few months ago, when I logged into my Amazon account, I was asked to review some of my purchases.For 2 items- I wrote reviews essentially saying that I personally did not like them- literally expecting nothing- I did not write these reviews asking or expecting a refund. However, very quickly after my reviews, these 2 (different) companies offered me refunds and I accepted.‚ñ∂Ô∏èWhen I tried to (re)claim these refunds- as Amazon credit nonetheless- the agents online, on the phone- would promise I would see these refunds in my account within 48h.It does not happen! üòïI contact them again, they escalate- but the issue never resolves and still remains to this day! I have not given up, but the amount of energy and time it takes to talk to 1 agent, only to be transferred to the next one, to the next- until someone tells you that you will see your refund reflected in your account within the next 48h.Rince and repeat.I dread contacting them again! EDIT- Also- since it appears there is no separate page for reviewing Amazon Prime Videos üì∫, here goes: ‚ñ∂Ô∏èAmazon Prime Video üé¨offers a fantastic selection of content, especially for indie, art-house, and European films and series‚Äîan area where it certainly stands out compared to other streaming platforms. ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èHowever, and this is a big HOWEVER üò©‚ùóÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èthe recent price hikes üí¥ üí≤are excessive, and the constant additional charges for add-ons are becoming downright absurd. ‚ñ∂Ô∏èAnother major concern is Amazon‚Äôs handling of temporary free subscriptions. ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èThey make it deceptively easy to sign up but unnecessarily difficult to locate, manage, or cancel these subscriptions. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èNavigating their platform to even find your active subscriptions or ensure you‚Äôre unsubscribed is frustratingly complex and disorienting and confusing and, naturally and consequently, these ‚Äúfree‚Äù trials too often slip by unnoticed until they hit your bank account.This approach feels sneaky, underhanded, and misleading‚Äîusing tactics that seem almost designed to take advantage of customers‚Äô forgetfulness.

Jairus Abimuheal,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Forgot my password for Amazon account. Password reset could only be sent to old mobile number no longer in use and was updated over a year ago. Amazon agent tried to resolve the problem by completing series of security checks including asking me to list purchases over the last 6 months. I told them it would have been simpler to send a password reset email. Apparently, they only send reset via mobile number on the system and to the original number when Amazon account was opened, even despite the number being updated. The only way to resolve the problem, as told by Amazon was for me to delete my account completely and set up a new one with new email address and mobile number. This action will also erase everything associated with your original Amazon account such as purchase history, gift cards, Amazon services etc etc. Definitely diabolical company. Please never forget your password and make sure your mobile number has been updated and if so ask Amazon to remove the old one which in my case was locked in the system. Also, check your bank card on the system as the ones I were told were mine belongs to someone else. Clearly they have messed up my banking details with someone else's. "

After contacting Amazon, they said it is returnable and I have to contact the seller. The seller responded, and told me to fill out a return request. I had to contact Amazon's customer service again to explain the dilemma. In fact, I had to explain the entire situation again. The Amazon customer service rep (2nd one) was extremely rude and very unprofessional. I have a feeling I am going to be stuck with this damaged item.

It has been here in my town since midnight the day before it was to arrive. I have exhausted all funds and the Amazon website says I could return or replace due to their delay in delivery. However the site lies. Now I am being told to fill out a refund form and wait 3 days for a reply to their investigation. I took pictures expecting the refund to be honored. I finally was able to order a refund that apparently will take 30 to do plus a possible 7 days for it to post to my account. Then when or if the part comes they want me to send it back. Print up their label and send it back. All this extra money spent and days I had to take off and now you want me to what? Getting this part back to you is of no concern for me. What should of happened is my refund issued as the proof of it not being here and then my dealings with you ate done. Amazon has just gone down hill.

tuti cavusoglu,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but after this recent experience, I am DONE with Amazon USA. If you're considering ordering anything from them, BEWARE: they won‚Äôt take responsibility for their failures, and if something goes wrong with your order, don‚Äôt expect any help.Here‚Äôs what happened to me: In August, I ordered 3 boxes of Rosabella Moringa capsules and had them shipped to my friend in Kansas City, MO, so he could bring them to me when visiting Istanbul. When he arrived, I realized the capsules were missing from my order. No big deal, I thought‚ÄîAmazon would surely help, right? WRONG.When I checked my Amazon account, I found a tiny, hidden message saying, ‚ÄúYour package may be lost.‚Äù No email. No notification. NOTHING. They expected me to constantly check my orders page on the off chance something went wrong‚Äîwho does that? Every other company in the world sends an email if your package is lost or delayed. Not Amazon.When I contacted customer service for a refund, I was told I had ‚Äúmissed the deadline‚Äù to report the lost package. They never even informed me my package was lost in the first place! How can I report something I didn‚Äôt know about? Despite my explaining this ridiculous situation, Amazon flat-out refused to give me a refund for an item I NEVER received. They took my money and left me with NOTHING.This is unacceptable from a company as big as Amazon. They have lost all credibility with me. Their complete lack of customer care and refusal to take responsibility for their mistakes is shocking. They just expect customers to absorb the loss for their failures? I don‚Äôt think so.If Amazon won‚Äôt refund a loyal customer for a lost order, then what hope does anyone else have if something goes wrong? Save yourself the frustration, and take your business elsewhere‚ÄîAmazon clearly doesn‚Äôt care about its customers anymore.I will NEVER use Amazon USA again, and I will tell everyone I know to avoid it at all costs. If you value your money and expect basic customer service, steer clear. There are plenty of other platforms that actually care about their customers and will take responsibility when they mess up.

Kate,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"At this point I‚Äôm fed up with Amazon. I have prime and still don‚Äôt receive orders for up to a week at least and items I purchase continue to get pushed back on their delivery date. I don‚Äôt see the point in Amazon prime when all of the features are useless. At the end of July this year I made a purchase on Amazon worth over $800 and have contacted them numerous times about the situation and got nowhere. After placing my order, I received an email saying that my order was cancelled due to unauthorized purchases although I was using the card I‚Äôve always used on Amazon. Because of this I‚Äôm down over $800 and it sure seems like nobody at Amazon cares to actually resolve the issue or help me. After contacting them numerous times, i made it clear that it was an authorized purchase and I was told that a message would be left for someone higher up to help me out as no one was able to find the order I had placed or didn‚Äôt understand what happened. The only emails and help I received from people higher up, was telling me how to secure my account by changing my password, which is obviously common sense to do so. I was originally told that the Amazon gift card I used for this order would be reloaded with the amount that was taken off of it for the order and this was a couple of months ago and still I haven‚Äôt received anything. I‚Äôve made many calls between when I placed the order and now and it wasn‚Äôt until last week when I called that someone was finally able to help find the order. I was told that she would contact the finance department in the company to take the hold off of my order and said that it would show up in the order area of my Amazon account. It‚Äôs been almost a week and still I don‚Äôt see the order in my recent order section or anywhere. Not sure why it would take so long to make a call and say it was an authorized purchase and to take it off of hold. I am beyond pissed off at this point and would just like my money back. Along with this you aren‚Äôt able to contact Amazon.ca through live chat for help and finding their number online is very difficult. I always have to go through the Amazon.com phone number and have to wait 10 minutes before a real person answers just to ask for Amazon Canada‚Äôs phone number. "
Brandi Butcher,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is single handedly ruining their business by allowing Chinese sellers on their platform.

They sent me a notification that it would not be delivered until the 18th of Oct. I contacted customer service for a refund of the items being as though they would not be delivered by the time they advertised it would be. I was told by one assistant that there was nothing they could do I had to wait for the package since it had already been shipped then do a refund process. The next two assistants I spoke with claimed the refund would be applied to my gift card in 2-3 hours the refund never came I contacted them again on the 14th and was told the same thing after speaking with 3 other assistants.   I made a review to inform other customers not to expect the item to be delivered the next day and why and Amazon refused to post the review due to community guidelines basically because I was informing customers the truth and that you don't have to wait the refund can be refunded to you the same day because it has happened before in the past. Be careful when dealing with Amazon for some reason they have a huge problem with the customers knowing the truth and that you don't have to wait until the package arrives, if it ever arrives, to get your refund. It shouldn't be a problem to be refunded your own money back if there is false advertisement for the delivery date. "

Tricia,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"As an American overseas, I'm baffled by the bad service that Amazon provides outside of the USA. The agents barely speak English, they use a lot of canned answers, you do not get the same warranty that in the USA. If something got lost: good luck with that, they do not care. The agents will lie to you, so they can close the ticket and when you follow up they just tell you ""not a chance"" and never acknowledge what they first agree.Reviews outside of the USA? even if you follow the guidelines, if you're disatisfied with the product they won't let you post  the review. Even if you read the guideliness and point to them that you're following the guidelines, they won't accept the review. I once requested someone that speak English so I could receive GOOD assistance, and they deactivated my account under the excuse that I was being racist. LIKE WHAT?! I had to get the BBB involved to try getting my account back.The items available? overprice junk from AliExpress and Temu. It came to a point that anything that I want to buy, I need to check with AliExpress and Temu first. At least on those websites I know that I'm getting a cheap chinese item and I'm not expecting quality at all as I would with Amazon.Prime membership is worthless. You basically pay a membership to be able to expend more money with Amazon. Prime series aren't good, you do not get Prime Music, or Gaming, or the good books.

I haven't received my item even so system says it delivered. First, that said I need to wait 2 days and call back if it's still not delivered. After that, they said they will start an investigation.

Paulina,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Something has happened with Amazon recently. I hardly ever find a product which I want to buy. This is because app is now packed with various sponsored products. Product which I am looking for is sometimes on 2nd or even 3rd page‚Ä¶ so I have to scroll and scroll to find it. I don‚Äôt want to waste my time on scrolling through few pages to find what I was looking for, so I just decided to shop somewhere else. I stopped my prime membership. And here is second weird thing which has happened recently. During last Prime Days (around 8th-9th Oct) I was not able to do any shopping at all because as non prime customer I didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button it disappeared for all products that were discounted due to Prime Days. Great way to increase sales! "

Natalie ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment with the handling of my recent order. On the 8th of October, I placed an order for an item priced at ¬£139.99, which was urgently needed as a gift for Saturday, the 12th of October. However, despite the payment being taken from my bank, the item has not been received, and the delivery status still states ""held for delivery.""I contacted customer service multiple times, and each time I was told to allow more days for the issue to be resolved. Most recently, I was informed to wait until today, the 15th of October, only to be told once again that no help could be provided and I should wait until the 23rd. This lack of resolution is unacceptable, especially as the item has missed its intended purpose.None of the customer service representatives I have spoken to have been able to assist in resolving this matter. I would appreciate an immediate investigation and a prompt refund for the amount of ¬£139.99. This experience has been extremely frustrating, and I expect better from Amazon."
Drew Flynn,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I used to rave about Amazon, and how good they are at delivering. However, they are getting worse and worse with every delivery. In the last month alone I have had 2 purchases out for delivery that did not arrive (presumably driver error), I have had 2 purchases held in warehouses (tracking data showing location), and I have had one purchase where we ordered 2 pairs of slippers with one pair delivered 36 hours earlier by Royal Mail than the other pair were delivered by Amazon. It‚Äôs not like I live out in the middle of nowhere, I am in a major urban centre. It‚Äôs just Amazon underperforming. "

officialbest,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Subscribe & Save a TOTAL SCAM! Ever wonder why there is a weeks long delay in getting your first subscribe and save item instead of them sending it right out? I am totally convinced it is because they know most people will forget what the price was they subscribed too once they actually get it weeks later. If you look at your invoice the rate is in my experience ALWAYS MUCH HIGHER than what was advertised and thus a total ripoff and scam. There needs to be a major class action lawsuit against Amazon because of this alone.
Silvia Palomba,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is the worst place where to buy , Amazon has failed to deliver 4 times with four different orders , which after I was forced to cancel my last order I then stopped to purchase trough themI only use Amazon prime video, so basically Amazon sent me an email to claim ¬£5 free to rent or buy a movie and despite I claimed it Amazon customer service was useless offered me ¬£5 refund to my bank card! Which I refused of course all I wanted was rent a movie with my ¬£5 credit given by them,after stayed 1 hours and over with 7 calls over the phone and one live chat I spend almost 2 hours without they not even helped me.

They said that they can‚Äôt refund me because they have observed abnormal activity !!!!! Like amazon being one of top security agencies. When made my point that my address hasn‚Äôt changed on the account, phone number hasn‚Äôt changed neither what makes them tell that it‚Äôs under abnormal activity they don‚Äôt know how to answer to that! They say we are going to open an investigation! How the investigation can prove that was me with my ID that they never had at first place?! Even if I am fake and I bought those things with my cards I am requesting the refund to the same cards!!!! This private companies are collecting personal information more than every security government agency in the world without any right to do so. If I do have a lawyer reading this please advise! How can I get my money without private company owing everything. My SSN went on the dark web because AT&T data was compromised and no-one is taking action by making this big companies responsible! Now amazon wants ID and fingerprints!"
Marguerite Donohoe,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Please be aware of Amazon taking money from account unauthorized. This has happened to me three times recently for an Amazon prime membership that I do not have . Each time I have went to my account and tried to unsubscribe from prime and there is no membership there so this money is taken for no reason. The last time I was assured by the customer service it would not happen again and my money would be returned which it was never and again this month the money was taken from my account only this time customer service say it isn't showing their end . I have to go through the bank, it may only be a small amount but it is very frustrating and unsettling that they can just take money when they want ."

Contacted Amazon Customer Service who spent all day trying to get an update for me.  I logged on Sunday to see the earliest delivery date was Wednesday.  I contacted Customer Services to see if under the circumstances an earlier delivery time was possible, but was told it was impossible.  I did not expect when I received a telephone call from Amazon for it to be the delivery driver at my home, when I had told them I was on a work training course.   I logged on when I returned home to try to reschedule the delivery, only to find it had been cancelled!   I have ¬£300 of food wasted due to no fridge or freezer and my order cancelled."

Cher,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I've been a customer with Amazon for a few years now and have never had any issues at all. I've returned items before and money was always promptly refunded to me as soon as the item got back to them. Last week I ordered a tablet and even it got here I realized it was too small and was going to need a larger one to work on so I returned the tablet but this time it was required that UPS pick it up instead of allowing me to drop it off at a drop off site(which was inconvenient for me since UPS couldn't give me an exact time they would come by) which meant I had to stay home all day until they came. The first day they didn't come so the 2nd day after being dinnertime with no UPS I decided to contact Amazon via live chat and they were great about the issue and put in for a new pickup and label link(the label was supposed to be printed at pickup by the UPS driver). At 6:30pm UPS showed up and told me they couldn't print the label with their machine but logged that they did pick up the item(being a $150 item made me a bit nervous about letting them take it without tracking info of any kind) so I took the driver's name and my mother in law took a picture for proof it was picked up before he left. 2 days later there still wasn't any change in the return status and still saying it needed to be picked up by UPS so I again contacted live chat at Amazon after calling UPS with no help there(they said it hadn't been logged yet&they would look into it but never called me again). Amazon looked into it right away and said they did have it but UPS didn't scan it properly so the item wasn't properly sent but they said since it was picked up that the refund was being processed which I got today actually. This kind of issue has never happened to me before with amazing and I was definitely glad everything worked out. I've been buying with them for years now and have spent a good amount of money through them and luckily haven't had any problems of as yet(fingers crossed).
Steen Ceeholm,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon is a hoax company. You only have 1 chance... If you need to login and do not have access to old mobile number - You are stuck.

Mattie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"- 6 October: I placed an order. It was supposed to be delivered on 10 October.- 10 October: The order has not arrived. UPS has not even received the package. Amazon states that the ""Package left the courier facility"" on 7 October, but that it may arrive two working days later, and should still arrive on 14 October instead.- 14 October: Nothing arrived. Amazon still stating that the ""Package left the courier facility"" on 7 October. UPS has still not received any package under the tracking ID provided by Amazon.- 15 October: Amazon writes ""We're very sorry your delivery is so late. Although it may still arrive, you can request a refund now."", but UPS states that they have still not received the package. I have requested a full refund. Now I got a message from Amazon that, in order to get back my money, I need to send back the item that I have never received.Why exactly has UPS never received the package that I ordered and why is Amazon at the same time claiming that the ""Package left the courier facility""? Why are they doing this? How am I supposed to ""send back"" an item that I never received in the first place? Is any of this legal? So many questions and no answers. I guess that Amazon just assumes that people will keep ordering from them because they are the big name on the market now, so they can do rediculous things like this without consequence.Update 16/10/2024:Amazon has processed the refund relatively quickly."

Example: order that was set for 3 days, looked the day it was to be delivered and they said by 10pm. The next morning they said another 3 days. This has become a very common experience. Amazon has fallen so far down I do not trust any delivery time stated. Amazon has been my first look in the past, no longer. I will check to spend my money with a company that has a system that is accurate delivery times in the future. It is really sad to see how far they have fallen."

Stuart thorn,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If i could give them zero stars or minus 100 i would. This company say all this rubbish advertise stuff on tv. It's all a lie they r worse then evri. There attitude stinks the service stinks yet they keep doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over. They haven't change there system well over 10/20yrs. The incompetence of the staff and delivery drivers pathetic appalling disgusting totally unprofessional. I could go on and on and on. I've ordered well over ¬£300 pounds waited iver 5 days 4 my 6 parcels. And the delivery driver lied which made me more angry. He said that he delivered at my home address? A total lie so what he does is he dumps my parcel on the doorstep which he thinks is my address? But this proves they don't listen to the customer andcas he driver has a insurance policy wuthnthe company the driver doesn't care aboyt customer satisfaction and excellent customer service. because as he thought he had the right address eben though i don't amazon it was. He still delivered at the wrong address with more of my parcels. Yet he didn't think hang on those parcels i delivered r still on the doorstep. Now u think he would think something is wrong here? But no he still dumps more of my parcels on the wrong doorstep. Basically the driver doesn't want to take parcels that's why they do what they do. But living my kids and me who r disabled us appalling and disgusting Behaviour from amazon.

Despite explaining the situation to various support associates, including a response from the Executive Customer Relations team, I felt my concerns were brushed off.

Bridget Kusturin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"We are currently working to get refunded for an item that was never delivered our house that Amazon claims was. We have had them hang up on us multiple times, we‚Äôve had them lie about the package being delivered here. My delivery tracking claims that their driver handed off the package directly to me, but it was not, and they are unwilling to acknowledge this. They told us that in order for them to reimburse us that we would have to get a police report. We got the police report, but truthfully told the police that the item had not been delivered to our house at the time that Amazon claims that it was we were home and would‚Äôve been able to receive the package. They still will not reimburse us because they want us to say that we took the package and it was stolen from us. They are doing everything that they can to not give us over $200 back. It is very clear that either the item was never sent out or their driver stole it. We do know that it was their driver because we called all of the other delivery companies that amazon uses to deliver packages, gave them the tracking number and none of them were familiar with it, which confirmed with us that it was an Amazon delivery van. I have never had any issues with them on small products but appears if it‚Äôs anything that‚Äôs large with any money that they are actually going to try to rip their customers off and thinking they can get away with it because they are such a large company. I‚Äôd like to know if anybody else has had this issue with them stealing from their customers?"

Stuart Glenwick,Rated 1 out of 5 stars," Im a long time Prime member, and just had a horrible customer service experience. I purchased a pair of shoes for $100 (have done so many times), but this time a signature is required. The delivery window was from Sunup to 10pm, and I was not home when they showed up. Carrier ( usps) will attempt to re-deliver at some point, but I don‚Äôt want to sit home for the next week awaiting a pair of shoes. I called customer service, who would not cancel the order and do nothing except tell me to contact the carrier. So, I did. Of course, you can‚Äôt talk to a human at USPS, and after an hour of trying to negotiate their customer disservice phone menus, I surrendered. I am not going to sit home for a 12 hour delivery window if I can at some point reschedule delivery, so I will have to let them make the requisite three delivery attempts after which they will return to sender and I will eventually get a credit. In the meantime I will visit my local shoe store and buy my shoes hassle free. I will never make another purchase requiring a signature on Amazon, and if this practice becomes widespread I will cancel my Prime Membership. If the convenience of the service is removed - what‚Äôs the point?"

Yacine Seye,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I have a 20$ gift card 
Naina Gupta,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon over promises and under-delivers. Sometimes it doesn't even deliver. The company blames the drivers. The drivers are under pressure and do not want to deliver to the door meaning that expensive items get lost and the customer is usually waiting or looking for something that was promised to be delivered. It is a terrible company with terrible ethics. The products they are increasingly bad quality as well. You might save a bit of money but it is not worth it at the end. 
ycj,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I made a purchase with Amazon on 25 September 2024 and decided to return the item 4 days later through Kohl‚Äôs. To this day I still have not received my refund from them. I‚Äôve called numerous times trying to see what the problem was. Every time I called I received different answers from different customer service reps. I‚Äôve even asked to speak with supervisors on two different occasions. The last supervisor I spoke with even sent me a confirmation email about my refund in a couple of days. Which I still have not received. Then I called back to speak with a member from a special team and they told me the items I sent back through Kohl‚Äôs that Amazon hasn‚Äôt received them yet. I couldn‚Äôt believe the different explanations from everyone I speak with at Amazon. It‚Äôs making me question why they are having such a hard time keeping employees at their job sites. I am highly disappointed with Amazon and their work ethics. Let alone every time I call I can barely understand what the customer service rep is saying with their strong accents.

John Birt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôve selected one star but if I could I would choose zero!I purchased a gift for my Grandson. It was delivered on 12 Oct 24. The item has no packaging so the deliver info sticker has been stuck to the box. Trying to tear it off it is starting to damage the box. So either I give the gift to my grandson with the delivery sticker still on it or I rip it off and damage the box. Neither option is palatable. The sticker was also stuck to the front of the box when it could have been put in the back. Very poor of Amazon. Boasting about reducing packaging but yet again the service level is reduced. I‚Äôm really disappointed. Also the ‚ÄòReturn reasons‚Äô options in the My Account section don‚Äôt include ‚Äòdamaged packaging‚Äô alone. I would return it but I won‚Äôt get a new one in time for my grandsons birthday. Absolutely disgusted. 
Terry Pitt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon courier are rubbish I ordered an electric toothbrush 6 October, was informed delivery Sat 12 October. Late Friday 11 October was advised order cancelled. which is frustrating enough but I placed another order for the same item and received notification that delivery next day 12 October.I have just received notice that access could not be gained which is total rubbish. Amazon should take a look at their delivery partners, THEY ARE LETTING YOU DOWN BIG TIME."
Peter Galindo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has been going the way of the Dodo for some time, but is rapidly getting worse. Recently ordered a toilet seat at $90, received a $40 seat after checking that Amazon had listed the order correctly, I spent my time getting refund.  Reordered the $90 seat, got another $40 seat.  Spent more time for another refund.they apparently feel that they were going to keep the $50 dollar difference each time. The newest episode involves an order on Thursday to be delivered on Friday.  On Friday, Amazon transferred the parcel to the USPS, which adds 2 days to processing.  So a one day order has become a minimum of 5 days for delivery.  Considering I pay $138 as a Prime member, for this kind of BS service, you would have to assume this is a con job.  I would highly suggest that shoppers check prices ( Amazon now has some higher prices than other sellers), and then decide if they want terrible service as well.  No wonder Bezos took his money and ran."
Sean,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Used Amazon for years then moved house early this year. Since living here I have only received 2 of the items I‚Äôve ever ordered. And Amazon say handed to resident sometimes with a photo of random front doors. Useless
Noel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've been their customer for 2 decades and I'm prime customer as well. I've personal as well as business accounts. Lately they have become front for dumping cheap Chinese rubbish in the UK. They also don't allow us to write negative reviews and delete the reviews if you write anything negative about them or the seller. Guess what if you are in the UK and try to setup a seller account they will do everything in their power to disable your account. This proves that they don't want UK businesses to sell on Amazon as they prefer Chinese sellers so that they can get away with Taxes and any repercussions. I've already started to wean off from Amazon. There are many UK based sellers who offer cheaper prices for many good and quality products. 
Paul Palmer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Shocking service and the problem is' they're too big to care.Although my account is in credit with gift cards I've earned they have blocked me from using any other service than digital, Why?Because their idiot couriers left parcels on my front door step and I never received them. By the way I live in a one way 300yr old Wynd where people using the Wynd to get to Yarm High Street, walk right by all front doors in the street, no gardens, no gates, just 500mm steps from the cobbles. It compares to leaving them on a busy street on your garden wall. Anyone can walk by and just take. After it happened the first time I sent them images ion my step and street and told them I have NO SAFE PLACE either leave with a neighbour or take back and card me. And a couple of months later they repeat. The arrogance of their ""Account Specialist"" who sign off as exactly thatAmazon.co.uk"

Why am I making this post now? Well that's because that today despite having two-step verification they have locked my account with ZERO warning & Customer Service were once again NO HELP! Just gave me the same copy paste answer from their playbook ""We'll send you an email within 24 hours"" That's just terrific in the meantime I'll still be paying my Prime membership for an account I can no longer access."

Since 4 October 2024, I have been trying to return the incorrect item, but the only option provided to me is through Royal Mail. This is highly inconvenient as Royal Mail only collects from Monday to Friday, and I work during these days. Additionally, there is no collection service on weekends.I have asked if I could return the item via a nearby Amazon Locker, but was told that Royal Mail is the only option available. This is unfair, as I did not receive the correct product, and now I am facing difficulties in returning it.I kindly ask you to offer a more convenient return solution and process my refund as soon as possible."

Steve Roos,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Amazon uses USPS to deliver larger packages, that USPS holds for pickup.  Who wants to wait in line at the Post Office?  UPS & FedEx work great.  I've told Amazon this is a problem, but they don't seem to care and there is no place to caution this on the order.  Once it happens, there is no way to do a return without phoning Amazon customer service and playing the phone maze/wait.  Come on Amazon, you know the Post Office is undependable.  Get your act together."

Dave,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so we all know Amazon are expensive, you can always find the item cheaper elsewhere on the Internet, however with Amazon the return policy was their unique advantage... Or at least it was, sadly no longer. To explain... I bought 9 items of clothing from Amazon in the recent Amazon Prime sale, they arrive and unfortunately their sizing was way out and far too big for me. I had assumed there wouldn't be a problem as I could exchange the items for the correct size. Unfortunately no, on these items Amazon have a no return policy which was completely invisible at time of purchase. How underhand is that?! Absolutely disgraceful, I have not even tried the items on, trust me I don't need to to understand they are massively too big.I'm not even asking for a refund, simply want an exchange for the right size but seems they'd are adamant no exchange possible.Please please read this review and bear it in mind before you purchase from Amazon. They are not the company they used to be."

In July I had 3 different issues with items either not arriving and needing to be replaced, or returned and then put off for receiving the refund. I am still awaiting a refund for a product that I asked for a replacement for in July, and was charged for the replacement 3 weeks ago.  The amazon reasoning was they never received the return, I never received the original item which was why a replacement was ordered. 7 times I was taken around in circles by customer service stating that they would issue the refund, I was even sent emails, all of which stated that the refund was being processed, it was not. AMAZON NEEDS new operations management and customer service that actually has the ability to get this straight for all customers!"
Vicki Study,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The customer service has been absolutely appalling.

david gavami,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been ordering items from Amazon for many years. This past week something has changed, they are now requiring a one time pass code on all my items. One that is still in route is requesting signature on delivery. They give me 4-5 hour window upto 10 pm. This has happened on all my recent orders. Obviously it is a waste of my time to stay home and wait for deliveries. It‚Äôs actually stupid way of doing business. Needless to say I cancelled my membership immediately. This company is so huge that losing a little guy like me is nothing to them or to Mr Bezos. I probably spelled his name wrong didn‚Äôt want to waste my time looking it up. I don‚Äôt get bullied by any business. We need to get them where it hurts. Stop ordering items from them. Then they will listen!!!"
Chirag,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is probably the worst online platform as on date. Their packaging standards are the worst of all or I should say missing totally since these days they simply send the item as it is without any packaging at all and then returns and replacements lead to more and more carbon footprint. Counter productive, I know!And if all this isn't enough, the customer support they have hired can't converse properly in English and have such poor communication skills, that you can't even tell if they're talking in present tense or past. Plus, they simply read out the information that even I can read on their website. I fail to understand why Amazon is even spending on having a customer support since they can't really influence any decision, they can't get in touch with the delivery team, they can't even connect me to the senior team or the so called 'Concerned Team' and lastly they keep on saying ""Sorry"" and ""I understand"" but still don't mean a single word of it.You try to point all this out again and again, they very conveniently blacklist you and don't let you ever buy from their platform again. Yes, they've done that to many whistleblowers and customers. It's time to decide if you still want to support such businesses or not.It really confuses me if the whole setup is done on purpose because those who actually have to take a decision are not allowed to converse with the customers and those who converse, cannot do anything and at the end of the day, the whole process is so time consuming that customer keeps wasting his time trying to get his concern addressed, which never happens.Being an MBA graduate myself and a consultant with many firms, it's pretty clear why this setup is so but then does it have to be so obvious? It's very clear the chain has been setup to deceive the customer in the end and yet it is the customers who pay for all the goods and services and still they're the ones at receiving end. Unfair, don't you think?I prefer supporting my local stores and family run businesses than these commercial profit hungry, greedy firms."
Kelly Chamlee,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They locked my account right before my son's birthday. I did everything on my end to get it unlocked. They said I have to wait for their specialty team which can't be reached by phone.  All my orders are on hold until my account is unlocked which means about $200 of my son's gifts are being held. They refused to give me my money for these items. They refuse to send my items. And now I'm stuck without being able to get his gifts becuase they won't send them and they won't give me my money so I can get them somewhere else. And the person on the phones could care less and told me I have to wait for the team to unlock it and there is no way to contact this team.

First. They don't have it, the account clearly marked as return received. They tell me I have to submit Id verification. It doesn't work. I went through a dozen different agents and got the same script and it was apparent that English was not their first language either. Last night. I then get two different excuses. It was stolen. Oh it was damaged. And the oh you need to submit Id again. WTH. "
Angel Perez,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is simply excellent. Every time I‚Äôve made a purchase, I‚Äôve received impeccable service. They are very serious about what they offer, and their customer service is fast and effective. I‚Äôve had a few minor issues, and they always resolve them without complications. Plus, the punctuality of their deliveries is impressive; orders almost always arrive earlier than expected and in perfect condition. It gives me great confidence knowing that if something goes wrong, Amazon responds. In short, it's a platform that makes me feel secure when buying, and it's always my first choice."
YSBroly,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"NEVER PRE ORDER FROM AMAZON.I pre ordered Dragon Ball Sparking Zero all the way back in June 2024 (4 months before release day) hoping to receive it on release day (October 11th 2024) BECAUSE THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF PRE ORDERING. However, I haven‚Äôt received the game on release day and it‚Äôs looking like the ‚Äúpre order‚Äù will arrive a few days late. Other people who pre ordered from GAME and Smyth Toys have already received their pre order on release day. What‚Äôs even worse, is some people got the game on release day without even pre ordering, by just going in retail store to pick it up in person. So my point is, if you guy want to pre order ANY game to get it on time, DO NOT BOTHER WITH AMAZON, but rather pre order from GAME or digital edition on the PlayStation store. No point pre ordering if you are not going to get it on time."

Lucy Loo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,As a family we order from Amazon almost daily. Sadly we've had a change in our regular delivery guy and one of the new ones is so clearly stealing packages. They log it as posted through our door and nothing is there. They've been reported to Amazon as potential theft and hopefully it will be dealt with accordingly. Unacceptable and it's now happened several times.

Mardoqueo Segovia,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So I bought a keyboard piano a month ago and they sent me the wrong one. I got a toy keyboard basically, all beat up and dirt. So I proceeded to return it the next day. They said it would take up to a month for me to get a refund. When I contacted amazon a couple of days ago they said the return was stuck at the processing center or whatever. Then asked me to send them I.D. because of suspicious activity on my account and it will take 3 days for them to even CONSIDER refunding. So my last step was to ask them to sent the refund to my bank account and not my Amazon credit card (I had payed with my bank credit card) because I don't want to buy from this company anymore and they said that they cannot do that! Beware of this company and you better go buy from other companies like Sweetwater or guitar center."

Mr Barry,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Speaking purely as a buyer (never sold on the platform), I've found them to be responsive to customer issues and problems, not that I've had many. A few times damaged goods over many many years of using Amazon, in each case it's been resolved promptly and with minimal of fuss.I know it's a bit company and I'd like to see more competition, but I at least feel mostly confident buying items there, v something like eBay which is very mixed in terms of users and sellers, some good ones and some awful ones who sell fake goods etc.I'm mostly happy, though the recent hike to ¬£35 for free delivery is a bit much I think (used to be ¬£25)"

customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give a -100 rating it wouldn't be low enough to rate accurately. This time an item was damaged during shipping and carrier sent back before reaching me. They know it was damaged and being returned as carrier issued the update but Amazon refused to issue refund so that I can reorder this much needed item. I am told to wait 2 weeks until they receive it back and then I can reorder. They KNOW item is damaged, they KNOW it's on the way back as the shipping carrier damaged it, reported it while reporting it was going back and never reached the buyer. Thus no chance of fraudulent return etc... now I cannot reorder as money is tied up in this damaged order I won't ever receive. Had an issue with an order 2 weeks ago they said I would be refunded for, medical equipment for my dying father and that never happened. When I checked in on that promise, the agent just bailed on the conversation and I chalked it up to one time issue and crappy agent. But again, again they left the conversation and when I called to speak directly to an agent they did the same thing. Told me they cannot help me at all. This is a lie, as I have had refunds issued in the past before they got a returned item, but now they say that isn't possible. I asked why this time ( especially when they know 100 percent its on its way back and damaged at no fault of my own) they refuse to answer. Do not order from Amazon, much safer and faster to buy locally or drive to the closest shopping center if you want something on time and be able to refund or exchange when you need to!Also, prime deals is a joke. Amazon is now a joke. As others have said, Amazon has gone to complete ####. The customer service chat is useless and keep sending you to other agents making you repeat the problem over and over until one decides to end the chat as if making you run in circles will tire you out to the point of giving up. Update: I received an email regarding the ticket number/issue asking if I was satisfied with the help. My response, was NO. I then get another email in response saying that they would need the order number etc.. as they don't know what I'm talking about when though they initially reached out to me about it! So I humored myself thinking maybe, just maybe this person might help. Nope, they responded telling me I was incorrect as it clearly states on my order that I will have it by the 15th. I ofcourse sent a screen shot of my order saying there is a problem and that the package was damaged and undeliverable. Amazon responded with,  yes we apologize but you have to wait for us to get the item back and investigate further. So they don't care, not even to check the order when you inquire about something or report a concern. If you want to buy from Amazon then be prepared for the worst and most careless customer service you will ever experience. Whoever owns this junk company, should start caring as it don't matter how big and successful a company gets, it's the CUSTOMERS that make or break you. And you are well on your way to start losing us. Update Oct 14-Amazon now says If I want to replace the items I have to pay another 40$ as the price keeps increasing and even though i never received they wont guarantee the price i initially bought it fo. I still have NOT been given a refund yet! Withholding my money on an item I won't get and refusing to replace it as an alternative unless I pay a higher price! Wasn't even a sale price, and had a rep issue false promises to correct a separate shipping error, whereby a manager told me, "" sorry, she lied and will be reported""  Sad, cause the only agent willing to make things better is being punished. This company has gone downhill. "

Clearly a template has been sent, but they have failed to swap the [Review title] and [ASIN title] for whatever the review or product is meant to be.  Similarly, their follow up where they proceeded to restrict the account fails to edit their template too, not swapping [Date] out for when the review was meant to have been left.Their links to the community guidelines dont help, as there is no way to find which guideline is meant to have been broken when they fail to provide a link to the review in question.Their support line is also useless, the response has been no help, just repeated the same cut-and-paste statements, without any attempt to actually address the issue, or just sending you round in circles to the same places you have been sent before."
RODNEY JAMES,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon allowing sellers to sell products with a promised delivery date before buying is a joke and has gotten much worst. If you are buying at Amazon, do not base it on their delivery date, its 50-50 if that will be when you get it."
Florian Best,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrible customer service over the online chat !A few years ago, online chat customer service was awesome.I don't know what happened nowadays, but it's a complete joke !

St. Luke's Lutheran School,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I want to set a business account for a small private school and since we only have land lines they will not let me set up a business account or use my personal number since it is on my account. I think this is one of the dumbest things I've heard and customer service said that they could do nothing to help me. I guess I will buy my school supplies from venders who want to work with small schools and be helpful.

Suellen Marane,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a beach cover up for my holidays and I never got it. Amazon drivers are leaving the packages at the door, not even knocking or ringing the bell (I work from home so I am always at home), and going away. For this particular order that I mentioned at the beginning, they marked as ""delivered"", but it was not in front of my building, I checked with my neighbors, nothing, the package disappeared.I got a refund from Amazon, but I was expecting the item. Sometimes we need to deliver the items to other buildings on the street because they deliver on our building, but it is not ours. Very messy."
Beverly Goode,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"My son & family are in Ashville. They have no running water yet, and things have been bad. I wanted  to help and placed several orders with Amazon to help them get essential items. They had began getting mail and had seen Amazon trucks in their neighborhood. I ordered over 2 weeks ago. EVERYDAY I get a delayed message. I feel so bad because items like paper towels, toilet paper and things like that are needed. I'm afraid the next thing I'll get is ""sorry but we had to cancel"". Something should have been posted saying if you are sending things to North Carolina expect delays. "
Bob Gunning,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is a follow-up to a review that I did a month ago.  I had purchased plastic green house sheeting because the application would expose the plastic to constant sunlight.  Bought it from some company in Ontario where it turns out they do not even show up in the company registry.  Anyhow, the company doubled the order, then accepted a return, then denied that the return shipment ever arrived.  That was all fraud.  Amazon's role in this is there postage guarantee.  The company allowed the return but refused to pay the return postage.  Amazon 's guarantee is that they will cover return postage.  The postal tracking number showed that the item was delivered but Amazon, even with that tracking information, sided with the supplier of the plastic and allowed them to claim no delivery.  I am updating this now because I went to VISA's fraud department to have the purchase transaction reversed.  They did their investigation of that same tracking information, confirmed delivery, and have refunded the original purchase.  Shame on Amazon.  This was pure fraud and they are complicit in that fraud.  Don't trust Amazon and don't trust their postage guarantee.  "
Luke Cartwright,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Been a prime customer for years. Have placed over 60 orders so far and most of the time I have had no problem with them. Next day delivery parcels have arrived safely at my door 90% of the time. The only complaint I have is that a few weeks ago an item was clearly delivered to a wrong address yet when trying to get in touch with customer service I was met with a bot telling me I have to wait 4 days before I can raise a claim or request a replacement/refund.

Brian Walker,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Extremely difficult to cancel Prime. Fee continues to be taken after many attempts to cancel. The only way to stop it is to remove payment card. That means no purchases until everything has ceased. Prime is only suspended so if card is restored payment is taken immediately. MONEY GRABBING 
Patti Self,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is a thief. They accepted 3 orders, take my money, and promise a delivery time, it never shows up and won't give me a refund for 3 more days. That is my money and it should be refunded immediately and Amazon should suffer not me. Then offer me a 20 dollar certificate, are you fricken kidding me? I am not a child, I am a business owner that has to suffer because of this company. Oh and I had to reach out to them when the products did not show up. Ridiculous. Hire some people in America that can actually help. You have lost my business permanently. Maybe enough people will get pissed and stop using your service (if you can call it service). That is my hope. I should have listened to my friends a long time ago and never, ever signed up. Thiefs! "

Ugggh. I will only order direct from here on out. This last package was in the Dallas area in their possession and said will be delivered today.

Frank Lucas,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is a convenient platform with a vast selection of products, making it easy to find almost anything I need. The shipping is generally fast, especially with Prime membership. However, I've experienced issues with customer service on a couple of occasions, including delayed responses and difficulty resolving issues. Additionally, sometimes the product quality can be hit or miss, depending on the seller. Overall, it's a good service, but there are areas that could use improvement. "
Pete ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I once thought Amazon was going to really break the mold and persevere as the best company for customer service. They were truly astounding for years I got a prime membership around 2007 and up to 2020 they bent over backwards even beyond anything I would expect. I bought a large expensive item and the seller charged me 2x the rate charged by the manufacturer website and Amazon refunded my purchase and said not to bother returning it (it was a giant tent which no way could I get it back in the box) we‚Äôre talking $350 so tonight I contacted them about a $24 order mixup that caused me to go past the 30 days and the agent had no resources to issue a credit amazing. So Amazon yes you Bezos is in the gutter just like every other money grubbing business end up. You could have made a statement Jeff ol pal but you failed to live up to your own vision. Really too bad ‚Ä¶ 
Jag Patel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Drivers delivered my orderes at the wrong address on multiple occassions. I called customer service and the representative  was extremely unprofessional.  I was told to go to a police station to file a complaint without which they refused to assist. They were not interested  to discuss what can be done to prevent similar issues again since I have pending orders. Basically I got no resolution and had to deal with an extremely unprofessional staff. Very disappointed!
Nigel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"End of a Customer RelationshipAt any other time I would without hesitation issue a 5 star review for Amazon. In my 19+ years of buying from this company and having become a ‚ÄòPrime‚Äô member at launch of this service, I have always found them to be outstanding in product offering, value, efficiency and particularly customer service. They are simply an excellent company to buy from and deal with.On the few occasions that I have needed to contact Amazon‚Äôs customer service, the staff has always been very well trained, efficient and very friendly and helpful.That was until I encountered Sebastian R, Kindle Supervisor on 22nd July 2024.Specifically, I had been following the author, David Gilman and noticed his new book; Betrayal was for sale on Amazon. The price for the Kindle version in Canada was and still is C$5.17 and was available instantly. However, when I tried to purchase the Kindle version the screen links to a totally different book by a different author.On June 15th I contacted Amazon Kindle Customer service and corresponded with Allan J who confirmed this issue and said that he would personally investigate and I would hear back shortly. It was the usual very helpful Customer Service contact.A Ticket was issued: V1418823232By July 5th I had not had any update, the book still appeared for sale and so I wrote to Kindle Customer service. I received a prompt reply from A. Roy, who apologized for the long delay and assured me that the issue would be resolved in 3 ‚Äì 5 days. And that Allan J. had taken personal responsibility for this issue. It was a very nice and encouraging email.On the 22nd July, by chance I noticed that the book was still being offered for sale but I had not received a reply from Amazon. So I called Kindle Customer service and spoke with a staff member. She advised me that the Ticket had been closed and that I must have been using the wrong search engine when trying to buy this book. A tad strange as I was using Chrome. This reply was a little annoying as I had not received a reply as promised, the books was appearing as still being for sale and Amazon had confirmed that their was an issue with the ‚Äòlink‚Äô to the Kindle purchase.I asked to speak with a supervisor and so encountered Sebastian R. From the outset I was slightly difficult to hear and understand this supervisor. He spoke very quietly and quickly. After 5 or so minutes he advised that the book was not for sale on Amazon Kindle and that the link was an error. Fine by why still show it as being for sale and why did no one from Amazon contact me as promised I enquired.The supervisor started to become agitated and advised me to ‚Äúcontact the author‚Äô ‚Äì why I could not understand? There then followed a non stop stream of angry shouting from the supervisor when I expressed surprise at his advice. Something that I had not encountered before from Amazon. Perhaps the unfortunate gentleman was unwell?I terminated the call (a first for me) and replied to Sebastian R‚Äôs review email with a note regarding his bizarre outburst. I noted that his email provided a link to Amazons Legal department if I wanted to use it? This was absurd and something that I had not encountered before with any retailer, let alone Amazon.So, on 22nd July I canceled my long standing Prime Membership and will not be using Amazon services again. I will add as a final note. The customer service person with whom I spoke when cancelling my membership was the normal, helpful, polite and professional person that I had always encountered at Amazon.PS. The Kindle book Betrayal, by David Gilman, is still showing as being for sale on Amazon as of 23rd July and the link still does not work!PPS. Amazon deleted all of my Kindle Library when I cancelled my account. This was unclear in the Terms & Conditions. The small claims court in Canada may be able to help clarify this decision."

Enoch ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Wouldn't trust amazon if my life depended on it. This is the second time within a month that my order has been screwed over. So last month I bought something worth 90 dollars was expected by September 25th at the latest. Long story short it was 6 days overdue so a whole month and was saying expected October 1st but I'm not sitting around ruining my plans so I can look out for my package cause I was worried it would be stolen. So I said screw it not worth my valuable time and requested a refund it's been almost a week still no refund I called them they said wait till tomorrow?? Like 24hrs makes a huge difference.......and had recently ordered a few more things that costs over 100 dollars but on the day of delivery for 2 of the 3 items  saying payment revised meanwhile they took the money out of my bank account without shipping my items....that's right they TOOK my money without even shipping my items so that's almost 200 dollars I have to go without and NOTHING to show for it I don't know what kind of shady business you guys are running but I will NO longer be ordering expensive things from you guys. Not worth it in this day and age with prices of everything going up. And I have to go through this, Wouldn't recommend to anyone. This is absolutely ridiculous. And there excuse for not shipping my recent order was because I requested a refund on my previous order for taking to long......I'm blown away at the level of shady activity from this company. If you value your money don't order from these guys."
Mackie,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon used to be good, but not any more. When ordering, they no longer tell you if a product is new or used. I ordered what I thought was a new DVD set, it arrived with only 1 dvd (the 3rd of 3 disks) and was missing the other two. A check of other titles showed the same lack of information (new or used). As I live in the country, returns are a hassle, as you have to find a UPS store, and my mileage negates any refund I might receive. Also, I couldn't give a negative review about the seller, although by this point my frustration level may have contributed to my difficulty."

Eventually I had no choice but to speak up and ask her to give me a second and listen to me. I clarified my situation and she informed me that I would be permanently locked out of my account and that there would be no way for her or anyone to delete or disable it so I could move forward creating a new account with the same email. It took minutes of me asking if there was anything that she or anyone else could do for her to finally tell me that she would put in a request to Account services (who I thought I was speaking to in the first place) to try and get my account back to me. She said it would take 24-48 hours for them to begin working on the request, which is fair. I just wish that she could have been clear and had some empathy for my situation. Had she bothered to listen to my concerns and express some sympathy I would not be so frustrated."
sue e,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Twice in the past week, I have bought electronics from amazon, a mobility scooter charger, and a battery grip for a cannon camera. both were a huge disappointment. far from being fit for purpose clearly Chinese fake goods and in both cases the mobility scooter charger has been known to explode was little better than a phone or PC charger and not powerful enough to charge a scooter, and the grip had buttons that did not work and at least one incident were it actually caused damage to a camera it was used on. Amazon is aware of the reviews these products get and has yet to take any steps to remove these sellers from its site. the goods that are bought in bulk and repackaged to be sold by companies that buy them are flooding the site. Amazon is not Temu Alibaba or Wish but it is getting there. if you cannot trust a company like Amazon not to allow fake knockoffs from China onto its site and take no steps to remove them from sale it is becoming untrustworthy and failing to protect the customers that use its site. If Amazon fails to take such steps it is saying we as a company do not care. "

Natalia Asbj√∂rnsd√≥ttir,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon are frauds! They took money from me TWICE and I never ordered anything! I talked to the costumer service and they didn't want to help me. Don't even make an account. I googled my issue after the lack of help because I didn't know what to do and turns out MANY people have fallen victims to Amazon.com. Check it out for yourselves, just Google ""Amazon stole my money"" and you'll read a bunch. All I wanted was my money back, money that THEY took without my consent. But they refuse to give back what they stole so now I'm spreading the word so hopefully no one else falls victim to this nasty scam company."
Antonia Clarke,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I use Amazon all the time and there great as long as it‚Äôs on cheap items eg cheap costume jewellery or random items. However DO NOT buy mattresses from them. It was a cheap mattress (in the sale it was ¬£89.99) it lasted 5 months max (after constant turning of it) I‚Äôve had so many issues with it!. It wasn‚Äôt as described and it fell apart material went all bobbly within a few weeks and the springs came through the supposed high quality memory foam which was actually the microfibres you get in cheap pillows!!. The manufacturer (starlight beds) weren‚Äôt interested. Amazon gave a ¬£13 refund and sent jd on my way. I‚Äôll never buy anything non branded or anything other that  bits and bobs from them again. Customer service terrible both at Amazon and starlight mattresses! Really disappointed! Only good for cheap items‚Ä¶

They said that there was nothing they could do about it. They told me that as long as they have my information there is nothing they can do. I had to have my bank card canceled again. I have talked to several different people who have gone through the same thing. Apparently, it is not uncommon what I am going through. I HIGHLY recommend that people not do business with Amazon. "

Virginia Williams,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Not sure anyone will even read this or care at Amazon. On Sept 1, 2024 a total of over $2500.00 dollars worth of products were ordered under my account and shipped to my home address as well as an address in OR. It was all FRAUD!!!! My account was locked. Amazon emailed me stating that they had locked my account. I started receiving products on Sept 2 and thereafter. 2-3 deliveries a day for a week. I have an entire truck of products sitting in my home. Amazons response, contact my bank. I file d police report and as the police were at my home Amazon was here with a huge delivery so he saw first hand what I was dealing with. How did Amazon not cancel these items or offer me to return the items for a refund? Since Sept 1st I have been given teh run around. I was told o Sept 8th I would receive an Amazon credit or gift card for the inconvenience. I received 2 texts which I was told not to click on because they are FRAUD! Today I was hung up on twice, now I will be honest I was not very nice but the old saying"" the customer is always right"" Amazon has never heard of. I was told I could not speak to a supervisor after calling 4 times today 4 reps, two supervisors my account is still locked, no refund issued or return labels can be made they say it is on my bank. I can wait 24-48 hours to hear back from someone I was told that on Sept 8th. Whomever scammed me wasn't smart enough to change the address for all items but they sure made sure that all the Firesticks, gift cards, Apple products were changed to the address they added. Amazon can't share that with me or the police. I can not believe a TRILLION dollar company could care less about anything. I am out the $2500.00 while the bank does a review that can take 90 days, I could have an instant refund if Amazon would do a refund you would think. This is the worst experience I have ever encountered. The lack of kno0wledge and care from the customer service team is sad. I informed the supervisor that I was finally connected to about being hung up on by two reps today and how I was told talking to a supervisor wasn't possible. Seriously Amazon? This has not just happened to me but I am getting this story out. As a long time customer once this is resolved I will never again be an Amazon customer. "

Stuart,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I was a big customer through Amazon. However I am not longer. They get third party sellers and do not back up their customers. I made almost a 100 dollar purchase. The items were delayed at customs for weeks. I requested a cancellation. The third party seller denied the cancellation. The items finally arrived damaged. The third party tried saying the batteries were not installed correctly and they were all three items ripped and worked for five minutes and stopped. Amazon refused a refund and said I had to ship them back to Hong Kong. Ok no problem but what if it gets delayed at customs? Then I am still without my refund. Buy somewhere else! Don't trust Amazon. They do not back their customers or do checks on these third party sellers.

One day I can buy for a reasonable price, in less than 12hrs, the price jumps somewhat moderately, and in other cases drastically. I'm not saying 50 to 60 %, but 200 to 350% on some items. I can buy from the Staes cheaper on some things, even with the exchange on the Canadian $. (Some things they won't ship across the border) It's become a waste of time to even look on Amazon. Cosco has far better pricing on some items that are sold on Amazon. Wanted to exchange something today in fact. Price when purchased yesterday, $34.99, today $40.99. Do not buy heavy items from them. They will accept return, but you have to pay for shipping costs. And to try and contact them, that;s another complaint. "

Salvatore Gugliuzza,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This is the worst seller and Amazon is also terrible for having this person on it and not backing up anything they do!!!!!  I bought this on Friday and paid $10 extra to get this shipped the next day for Saturday.  I looked online Sunday and wondered where the book is and it says they issued me a refund.  I called amazon and said what the heck and they say yes it was damaged during shipping.  I need this book by Monday for a new job I am starting and they say oh well....we already issued the refund and you will get your money back in 3 to 5 days. They said I a have to go an Amazon and go and buy another book but I don't have the money to go and buy another book and they basically said too bad! I would always depend on amazon when I needed something but literally my last 3 orders have been exactly the same way.  Late on delivery and they don't care.  I said why can't you just give me a $20 credit to go on Amazon and rebuy the book so I still get by tomorrow Monday!  They tell me since it is a 3rd party there is nothing we can do!!!  I am sorry but if you have a seller ON AMAZON then they represent AMAZON and whether you AMAZON driver damaged the product or something happened on there watch means they are responsible for the delivery of my item.  I am SO upset about this and talked to 3 people at Amazon and they all told me OH well nothing they  can do.  SO DO NOT Buy from this seller and stay FAR AWAY from Amazon.  They could not even give me the $20 as a credit to buy the book so I could receive it by Monday when I start my new job.  Not everyone has tons of money like amazon and they proved they do not care about the customers loud and clear after this stunt!  So BEWARE of this seller and amazon and please do not count on either of them!!!!!!

Bronson Brieske,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"On September 17h 2024, I was recently scammed from a scammer pretending to be a customer service representative on Amazon. I called this number  1-808-260-2094 thinking I was talking to an Amazon customer service representative. The scammers name that was used was ‚ÄúJamon S. Reagan. He instructed me to call his warehouse number that I thought was legit. That number used was 715-500-3956. He had an Indian accent.The scammer then told me to download the ‚Äúclient app‚Äù so he could help track my Amazon package that wasn‚Äôt delivered and he needed to verify my address. He insisted this was the only way to verify my address was correct and to purchase a gift card for verification. So he instructed me on how to do that. After purchasing the gift card, he said it didn‚Äôt work and to purchase another gift card.  He said the second gift card didn‚Äôt work either and to try it one more time. After purchasing 3 different gift cards, he told me to give it 30 minutes and I should receive a link from his number 715-500-3956 and to follow the link they provide to get my gift cards refunded back to me.I waited patiently for 30 minutes only to never hear back from him again. I tried calling the numbers back and nobody answered.All 3 gift cards totaled $405 dollars.After spending 7 days notifying Amazons fraud department each day, they told me I had to wait 24 to 48 hours as they investigated the fraudulent charges. I then notified my bank and emailed all my emails from Amazon and the screenshots I took from the scammer erasing my name and email and leaving my phone number and using his name and his email address.Meanwhile I called the third party where the gift cards were purchased for. They told me they were all used and there was nothing they could do. Thankfully my bank was able to refund my lost amount of $405 within 2 days of sending the scammers information and the emails from Amazon stating there was nothing they could do. I will never use Amazon again after the lack of care and concern they showed me along with the disrespect I received from ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù the fraud department supervisor, who laughed at me when I told him how I was scammed. Leo‚Äôs number is 1-866-216-1072. He should be fired for his unprofessional behavior and laughing at me for being scammed. I encourage everyone to beware of the gift card scam and stop using this horrible company ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù to purchase anything online. They will not protect you from scammers and instead will laugh in your face for being scammed. I will be contacting the ‚Äú BBB‚Äù and informing them of this horrible service and unprofessional customer care I received. Please share this with anyone that uses this horrible company. It‚Äôs best to buy from the company of the product you want and leave Amazon out of the equation. What a terrible company Amazon is. They should be ashamed of themselves. "

Chelse,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon driver entered my house and put my package inside my house! Never had this happen before and delivery instructions do NOT say to enter my house at anytime. Never had this happen before and I was terrified as I have kids. The fact this driver felt comfortable entering a home, is NOT okay! I even have the delivery picture of him holding my door open with the package inside my house! "

I have now opened up an investigation through my Bank to get my x2 refunds. TERRIBLE & I MEAN TERRIBLE SERVICE and Treated as if I am not worth Anything to amazon. I will not have ANYTHING to do with Amazon ever and I will wait for my bank to get funds back. Disgusting and Shocking Services Through-out.
Mark Barrow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Really unhappy with fact that Amazon has delivered my package elsewhere and they expect me to sort it out and they will only investigate after 48 hours.

Austin,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Anyone else notice an increase in false delivery times? I've ordered multiple items for same or next day delivery only for the date/time to keep getting pushed back. I'm ordering items specifically for the rush shipping only to be let down.  Looks like consumers need to start going back to brick and morter shopping to ensure expediance.

DesertFish,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There was an alert Aug 2024, in my account with Amazon, for a bike helmet that was recalled due to safety issues.

Sam Chinnis,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has changed its return policy.  If you order anything of value a return will take 30 days to get a refund.

John Heinrich,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to share a recent experience with Amazon that I hope will be instructive.  In early September I ordered a box of 4 Bussmann T-8 fuses for $22.00.  When the shipment arrived I received 1 fuse.  I contacted Amazon with regard to the error and they told me to return the fuse and reorder the item.  I few days later I received 1 fuse.  I went through the same process again and a few days later received 1 fuse.  I finally managed to reach someone at customer service who reviewed my records and proudly told me he was authorized to replace my order at no charge and I could keep the 1 I had.  A few days later I received - wait for it - 1 fuse.  In the meantime, just by the way, the vendor increased the price of a box for 4 fuses from $23 to $41.99,. which means it would be cheaper to buy 4 individual fuses rather than a box of 4.  Undeterred and slightly bemused, I again spoke with someone at Amazon customer service who, after reviewing my tale of woe, told me in his sternest voice that he would review this with the vendor and whoever was responsible would ""suffer the consequences.""  He also told me to return the fuse I had received most recently and wait 48 hours to reorder the box of 4.  He also sent me an e-mail stating that when I reordered the fuses, Amazon would pay the difference between the original price and the new price.  To say that I am skeptical about the outcome is a huge understatement.  There is not a lot of money involved her, but a tremendous amount of wasted time, aggravation, and bad faith.  The only reasonable reaction is to quote that famous thespian, Damon Wayans, in a line from The Last Boy Scout:  ""Is everybody stupid around here?""  We shall see."
Lolly,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"As a long time Prime user, I used to love shopping on Amazon. They valued their customers and wanted to provide the best possible shopping experience. Recently,  I have had customer service reps lie to me and Amazon management make no attempt to review the conversation. I have had items get charged back even though I returned them. You have to be very careful because if you don‚Äôt watch you could be charged for items you don‚Äôt have. I was told  Amazon will ban you if you dispute a purchase. So if Amazon requires you to keep a purchase of a defective item you didn‚Äôt want, Amazon does not have to give you an immediate credit. A disputed charge would rightly immediately remove a charge if the item is used or defective.  I will have to revisit other merchants and perhaps this is for the best. I never price shopped on Amazon and know items are not always less expensive there. The convenience was what made it worth it but now I am losing trust. I would be very careful when doing business with Amazon. "
Tayla X,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Please beware!!! I was overcharged for this item for no apparent reason and talked to 7 different agents about it who were unwilling to do anything!!! They robbed me and its sad. The fall of a company starts with the customer service!!! Very hesitant to place another order after speaking with two of the nastiest supervisors Ive ever talked to in my life!
Rick Plage,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I have greatly enjoyed Prime, but you have to be smart about your own situation.  First of all, I got the Prime credit card that gives 5% off anything purchased on Amazon.  That 5% discount ends up approximately paying for the cost of Prime.  Maybe if you live in a larger community with good shopping, you don't need Amazon much.  I live in a small desert town where we have very little, though there is a Walmart nearby.  I suppose I could go all in with Walmart, including online, but Amazon has a greater selection and usually better prices.  So for me it's Walmart and Safeway for food, Amazon for everything else, plus a few items at small stores where I like to support local businesses.  Tucson, with an Amazon warehouse, is less than an hour away, so I do get next day delivery on many items.  I'm in my 70's and I don't care to drive in a city.  For a rural person like me, it's almost a miracle to have so much available for delivery the next day.  You couldn't get that years ago.  Only once have I had to return a valuable defective item, and I received a credit to my card's account immediately.  I've never had a problem with Amazon Prime or the card.  My only regret is that Amazon (and Walmart) make it hard for local startup businesses.      Okay, your situation isn't like mine, so you have to weigh whether Prime is worth it to you.  Read the negative reviews too, and keep in mind that when something screws up badly, that person is more likely to write a review than is someone who's done fine.  For me, Amazon Prime works, and I hope you too have glad thankfulness for all that you find working right for you."
Rob Snelling,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,It is what it is. I actually miss the old way of life with less globalisation and more focus on local stuff so I‚Äôm not a fan of huge companies as the customer service is always so poor when places are so busy .. but it is what it is and does what it says on the tin you want something you search it you buy it simple
Jorge V,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,3 out of my last 6 orders have been late. Amazon should not push same day delivery or even next day delivery. It has been a total disappointment more often than not. 
Upset Customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I ordered several items on the ship and save option of what Amazon offers for some of their items. I do this because I am on a fixed income and this helps me save money versus having to pay a higher cost in the local grocery stores. Some of these items are very expensive in the local stores in San Diego. This past order that was supposed to be delivered on the 26th could not be delivered because the package was damaged during delivery. I get an email saying that if I do not get my packages by the 27th to call Amazon. Today is the 27th and they did not even give me a chance to call them, they just automatically refunded the order of 5 items that I needed not only for me but for my daughter also. When I spoke with a customer service supervisor, they said that they could not just reship the order, I had to reorder it and pay full price versus the discounted price that I was promised on their site when I placed the order. The only thing they could do was put a $50 credit on my Amazon account to try and make it better. I did not need that I needed my items shipped!! I have been a Prime member for over 5 years and lately, everything with Amazon has gone downhill. Their shipping is terrible, the quality of the items is terrible, they damage packages, and do not give any reasonable options. Not to mention that they charge you for anything extra now. The Prime membership is a joke. They changed the way you listen to music, they changed the way you can watch free movies and shows - you now have to watch commercials. If you want it to be commercial-free they charge you for that. Don't they already charge enough for the membership? Why charge more? I am done ordering from Amazon - this will be a last resort situation if I need something in a hurry, however, I will not rely on it because it will probably be lost or damaged and they cannot deliver it. Do Not Trust Them Anymore! They will just rip you off!!!! Oh, and you will probably not get a response back to your reviews because it will probably cost yu money to do that! Get real Amazon!!!!!"

Usually, I say how incredible they are and how much they have gone out of their way to help so I am deeply disappointed. I bought an expensive item that was not quite right but immediately went on holiday for 2 weeks before having a chance to return the item. I knew I would miss the return window by a few days and got in touch with Amazon while the return was still valid. I was assured it would be no problem, to just get in touch when I was back and they'd manually sort a return and full refund. I have now spoken with 3 amazon agents, wasting over an hour of my time, all of whom have been rude and unhelpful. I'm now stuck with a product worth several hundred pounds which does not do what I require."

Iryna Kharchenko,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Amazon for years, but I have never had this problem before. I am talking about digital content. I lived in the US and have Amazon.com account and then moved to the Netherlands and now have Amazon.nl account. My Kindle was connected to .com account, so I didn‚Äôt notice that my digital purchases were not downloaded and instead I had only samples. I couldn‚Äôt even see my new books as they were not showing up in my library, I could only access them directly through the page of the book on Amazon. I started reading and of course I came to an end of the sample. Then I couldn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. Contacted CS, first of all a person couldn‚Äôt understand what I am talking about and it took about 30 min and countless attempts of trying to explain that I would like to merge two accounts under one kindle, since both of them are mine and I am the same physical person (I can send whatever proof they need). After a long chat I find out that it is impossible to do, I can either use .com account or .nl account. Stone Age is you ask me!On top of it I am traveling, so I couldn‚Äôt log in to my account and due to 2-step verification I could get the code send to my phone number. Have you heard of digital nomads at all? Hello Amazon? Make it user friendly! Allow to add multiple phone numbers under one profile, so I can get an sms you are sending me wherever I am. After spending altogether about 2,5 hours trying to figure everything out plus log in to my account I finally was able to reset a password and login to kindle with my .nl account. Guess what? Since my highlights were in the sample of course they remained in the sample. Now I have to spend additional hour rereading everything and highlighting it again.What a nightmare! I expect a bit more advanced approach when it comes to Amazon! "

Seeking to censor free speech, is more like what this is.I have posted my so called, Community Guideline busting words below:""The CRST WiFi Extender Booster Solved my connection problem - but...The ability to write FULL instructions - in ENGLISH - is apparently superseded by a need to offer (seemingly) the entire worlds languages. Thus we create a document requiring a magnifying-glass to read it. Not that there is much of any real help in it anyway.""I went on to suggest a web page on 'You Tube' offering  really useful help on this type of thing and gave it three of the five Stars available.Quite how this became unacceptable to anyone seeking to provide good service in the business of providing customer satisfaction is a mystery.Amazon WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? please buck up!Your excellent delivery and wide range of decent goods is let down not only by this childish nonsense, but the increasingly common idea that allowing people to make actual contact with a human - gifted with the ability to deal with a complaint or provide pertinent advice - is nigh on impossible to find.

Vincedbaxter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"So I placed an order they took my money out of my account and then froze my Amazon account and put all my orders on pending after they already took my money. I call customer service and they say"" it's going to take 48 hours for us to review your account before we can do anything.""  What the he'll do they mean. They already took my money. So then I wait the time my account still not unfrozen and my money was still gone from my account and the orders are still pending. I tell them I want my account closed and I want a refund they say ""ok you are going to have to wait until your account is unfrozen and then it's still going to take 5 to 7 days for the money to go back on your account after its unfrozen."" WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!?!  I will never use Amazon ever again in my life. And besides I should have never used them in the first place because they are just stealing all the money from all the real people trying to make money in the mom and pop stores. So yeah never Amazon again. My money is going to the people who really honestly work for it for their money as should you and everyone else in the world. Everyone thinks that they are saving money when they order from them,but there is a much bigger picture to it and we are F***ing ourselves for letting them stay in business."
Me,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They seem to have gone downhill big-time. Simple things that should take only a few days to ship are taking weeks. Some very false advertising product weights, from 62 pounds to the reality of 4 pounds, yet still showing very low price per ounce to get you to buy. Refunds for canceled items are a nightmare. "
Nancy C.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon used to be good.  Not anymore!! Now you can't depend on them shipping your items before the date they're scheduled to arrive.  My order placed 9/14/24 was supposed to be delivered 9/20/24.  Today is 9/24/24 & it still has not been shipped.  I called customer service & was told if I pay $11+, they will ""expedite"" shipping so it arrives by OCTOBER 11.  Forget that!!  I cancelled my Amazon order & placed Walmart order, which is scheduled to be here this week.Amazon should think before screwing over their customers.  We can shop elsewhere.  I am."
William Gates,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon has gone downhill .   They are crap now I pay for prime and the prime deliveries are always late the drivers always leave the items at the door so if things go missing it is their problem and not the customer. I would NOT recommend Amazon to anyone now and if asked I would tell them to not use them also the cost of prime per year is extortionate 
David Ramos II,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been canceling Amazon Prime membership since May, and they keep charging me. Everytime I log in to ensure that I no longer have the Prime membership, it states that I don‚Äôt, yet I keep getting charged. No other company makes it this difficult. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people have the same issue as I do. Im surprised that they are allowed to continue running like this. Wait, no, they have money- I‚Äôm no longer surprised."

Eric Donohue,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon's customer service is such a joke, they have no answers and can not do anything for you.

Call customer service, and they tell me just wait till 8pm the next day and if you don't recieve the product then we can help... So I picked an item that would be delivered the next day because i need it then, and now i may get it 1 day after it was promised. If not that day o will have to wait 2 more days to reorder it/ get it... this sounds like a scam by Amazon abs this is not my first time. "

I ordered something from someone off Ebay and it came from Amazon and I returned the item immediately to the seller explaining I don't patronize Amazon at all. Amazon has ZERO customer service could care less what their customers want or need as far as service. My last item showed Out for delivery only to remain on their truck at the end of the day. Next day showed Out for Delivery and again showed back up at their place not delivered.  Third day Amazon canceled the order stating they could not locate my item. Issued a refund , another 4 days to get that. NEVER AGAIN. As a resort operator we spent a high 5 figures amount annually.  Now not even .01 cent."

I did but then held on a call for ages, as told sorry the Amazon system cant replace, I need to send the Faulty Iron back and order a new one. No particular issue, other than the New one had gone up in price by ¬£6.01.Why is this my problem, I've spent a few hours following ""THE AMAZON PROCESS"" only to find I get stitched up at the end.

Tabby bailey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a laptop for my daughters 11th birthday when she tried to use it it would only work while plugged in and then kept resetting to factory setting so I contacted Amazon customer service. They issued a replacement,  the replacement got lost. I tried to get them to issue a new replacement and explained that I didn't want to take away the faulty one from my daughter until I had a replacement. I was told they couldn't get another replacement so after 3 very frustrating phone calls and at least 4 30 minute chats where their associates kept getting disconnected because of ""technical issues "" and having to explain everything again, I was issued a refund and told to toss or donate the faulty laptop and didn't need to return it. I was assured that I would not be charged for not returning it. A couple weeks later after thinking it was resolved I started getting notifications from the bank that amazon was trying to charge my account. So again I contacted them. I had another 5 conversation everything I had to explain everything, each associate said they had resolved the issue, each a different way,  none of which actually ever happened. I was told I would receive emails confirming,  that the money would be in my account in 48 hours,  that I would have to accept a gift card..they suck! They issue automated responses,  don't actually care to help you, just want to appease you until they can pass it off to someone else.  And the fact that Amazon doesn't allow open reviews on their customer service proves they know it!"

Don‚Äôt even read the complaint raised and talking to me like a child. Recently learning that children cannot make purchases but can easily set up an account like an adult without any security measures in place.

Patrick Sifneos,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Since Amazon turned everything to use AI, there is no support at all. There is no way to contact a human at Amazon, you are mailing and chatting with a stupid AI system which can decide and close your account for absolutely no reason.

Consumer Scott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They will fail because of horrible customer service. I ordered printers Inc. and when it was delivered, it was thrown into an envelope the jar shattered and leaked all over my tile front porch stain it. I called to report the damage it took a week before I was even told that there was a claims department I was hung up on placed on hold hung up on again in total. I spent 20 hours of my time documenting emailing to try to get some compensation for the damage that was caused in the end. They categorically denied any responsibility for the stain, even though I supplied photographic proof that was ironclad, they simply refused their insurance review board ARC is a sham. They deny all claims without any merit and they cannot be prosecuted because the laws of changed so as hard as it may sound, I am not using Amazon anymore. I‚Äôve canceled my prime membership. I‚Äôve canceled my business membership and I‚Äôm going to buy from individual retailers who sell things online. "
Brian Vander Waal,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I did NOT receive the discount that was advertised on their website. The first customer service agent said she would refund me for the discount I didn't receive. However, she then said there was a technical error and passed me on to someone else.  That person then refused my refund. I have been chasing it for many days since. Amaxon's customer service is shameful and the worst in the world.  They are a bunch of liars and cheats.  If I could rate them a zero, I would. They certainly do NOT have customer obsession."
Cherokee Rose Thomas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am an Amazon prime member, Kindle, prime, video, audible books, and I order a lot from Amazon.

I have asked Amazon to take a certain item off my search bar that I don‚Äôt want there and they haven‚Äôt done it yet. They never knock. They never put the product where you ask them to put it they put it where they want. Customer service apologizes for what was done, but they do it again.

Same thing happens last year when their drivers weren't given enough time for bathroom breaks, so they were peeing into drink bottles and tossing them out the window (local news)!!!

Kristine Bailey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"These days, the cost to be a Prime member has increased substantially, and the benefits of being a Prime member have severely decreased. Amazon used to have an excellent refund policy. Recently, they've instituted a 30-day refund policy. What company makes a customer wait 30 days for a refund? Especially when the item being returned is defective? Additionally, their customer service, which also used to be excellent, is at an all time low. Now, you have trouble getting through, and when you do, you end up engaging with artificial intelligence that is only programmed to ask and answer 3 questions. Then, if and when you finally reach a human being, it is someone with an accent who talks with the speed of an auctioneer, or someone who is calling a square dance. Plus, they are extremely rude. Also, I used to get a call or an email within hours of emailing the Executive offices. Now, it can take several days. And they too sometimes are rude, and less than helpful.It makes me wonder if Jeff Bezos even knows the low level to which the customer service of his company has reached since he stepped away. +"

E.M.M,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I‚Äôve been with Amazon prime for three of years and boy has it declined the service never was like this it is far worse and sometimes get warehouse stock (used/returns) When you order you which is not good enough customer service is far harder to get onto now and the standards of slipped dramatically as for prime next day delivery is about 75% worse than it was next day is at times I think of the past it states next day, but what do they think next day is next day keeps changing the date on the delivery sometimes it changes it four or five times before it‚Äôs actually arrives when you‚Äôre expecting it the next day I have stopped my prime now because the price is gone up but the standard is dropped. They offer no loyalty amounts or discounts for people that have been with them and being loyal for many years. I‚Äôm sorry Amazon but your service isn‚Äôt what it used to be please return to how it was used to be great. I had one very expensive item which was approved by Amazon to send back The guy told me 30 days to return however I could not find the link so I rang Amazon again. It was about 10 days after to be told no I couldn‚Äôt return it because I hadn‚Äôt returned it in seven days but he definitely quoted 30 because it was a question I asked hence I was landed with a faulty product, which is just under ¬£400 in price it does not stand well it‚Äôs ridiculous if you‚Äôre non-prime member you need to spend ¬£35 to get free delivery fair enough but it‚Äôs not automatically taken off. You find the unless you go down the boxes and take it out of the delivery box on one item or more you still get the delivery charged attached unfortunately I‚Äôve fallen for this three or four times without even realising the items sometimes says on it free delivery so you don‚Äôt bother to check, and then you check later on I‚Äôm fine that you were still charged ¬£4.99 for delivery once you hit the ¬£35 threshold it should be taken off automatically very very very unfair. I will continue to buy the odd thing from Amazon. I‚Äôm not saying I won‚Äôt but I won‚Äôt be expecting it in any hurry and I‚Äôll be very wary of what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve had faulty goods. I‚Äôve had damaged boxes I‚Äôve had warehouse stock and delivered different stock you might order one thing and they send the other for instance I ordered for my elderly mum some chair raisers I ordered three times the 3 inch ones and each time I was sent 2 inch ones sometimes they send the wrong colour but I sometimes think as well they don‚Äôt bother to look too busy chatting you put down super king bedding and you get king has got a ridiculous state now. I orders a small ladies fob watch twice and both times got a completely different men‚Äôs one I have a complaint to make at the moment and I cannot get through to do any complaints. Some idiot delivered a box of chicken wire very heavy large amount to my front door instead of leaving it propped up against the wall he propped up to the door which would be open inwards onto me hence this very heavy package fell straight on my shins scuffing my shins and my legs. Really nasty scuff and bruises also I have back problems and had a hell of a job to pick it up to re close my door It‚Äôs just not good enough. Do none of these people have any common sense I wonder this is not the first time it happened please, please don‚Äôt put parcels against an opening door for people to get hurt when they open"

I called customer service and they said to order it again and they would refund the price difference to my account.  It did not happen.  When I called a couple of months later to ask about it because it was never done, they said the time had passed and it could not be refunded for the difference.  I told them I had been patiently waiting for the credit and didn't follow it daily and realized it had never been done.  They said it was too late to get it now.

Rodney Field,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon customer service has always been challenging, but now the company simply doesn‚Äôt care at all.

Doug,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"There are just too many issues to put into one rating that I have personally had to put up with because Amazon will not honor delivering things properly, on time, on the delivery date, deliver the proper item that I actually purchased, and not deliver damaged items on top of not putting me through hours on the phone through chat and actual human discussion on a refund or return.  I will give just one example from today:I received my ultra thick bathing wipes for my disabled wife who must be washed on her hospice bed at home, And the box was soaking wet from busted wipes inside the box.  I cannot use the entire set because everything is soaked on the inside and I can‚Äôt decipher if it‚Äôs from the leaking packs or something else.  I‚Äôve spent an hour on the phone With the robot and then two people on chat, who disconnected me and then two people on the phone who kept transferring me and never resolving my issue.  The application will only allow me to return the item which I cannot do since I am homebound, taking care of my disabled wife, So I guess I‚Äôm just $35 for this order and I have no wipes for my wife‚Äôs bottom."
Stephen B,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying from Amazon for quite some time now but have noticed over the last year or so the customer service has tanked. Three of my last six orders had items to be returned not because they were damaged in shipping but because they were shipped already damaged! Today it was a new dry-rotted rubber doormat, last week an outdoor sign that was crushed and had forklift tire marks on it.

Billy Rogers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon is full of thieves this is the 3rd time they have tried to double charge me from a prime account all Amazon does is steal from people so watch your transactions closely if you have a prime account chances are they have been charging you twice a month for your prime account 
Sean from Galway,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"As a person from Ireland I won‚Äôt buy from Amazon UK again, and I would recommend others not to buy from the Amazon UK website. I bought an AMZCNC hydraulic hole cutter tool. It broke the first and only time that I used it. I have sent 22 emails to Amazon UK and have only received computer generate generic emails. Nobody from Amazon UK has addressed my issue. I phoned and spoke to an Amazon customer representative and they were not interested in my problem - they won‚Äôt repair or replace my AMZCNC tool which is now 4 months old. Best of luck to anyone looking to get something repaired / replaced from Amazon when it is under Warranty."
Keith Buth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered a brake hose for my car on sept 6.  One day delivery. I tracked it and on the 7th (delivery day) it said the 8th. On the 8th it said delayed.  I chatted with customer service and they said the 12th.  He said because of the screw up he would refund my payment and could keep the item.  On the 12th it said delivery on the 19th.  I chatted with customer service  again and he said he would send a slip to expedite shipping.  On the same day it said shipped.  The next day it said lost. I called again and they cancelled the order and ordered a different one.it finally came the 16th.  When I asked about refund they said they had no record of the first chat. I said I would copy and paste the conversation but was told they have records and was pretty much told I was lying about mine.  So on one order I was lied to 5 or 6 times.  Pitiful just pitiful
Bill,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bought a graphics card that I no longer needed because I purchased a different video card from Amazon.  Both video cards were purchased from Amazon.   I received notice from Amazon that the first  video card was approved for refund.  I then received notice that a return label would be provided within 5 days.  No return label was provided.  Now I am stuck with a $400+ graphics card that I don't need.  Spent several hours with Amazon customer support with no results. The graphics card was from an Amazon 3rd party.  I will never purchase again any item from an Amazon 3d party.

Roger S.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My experience of Amazon today - The problem is not the associate who handles the call, but his or her lack of ability to effect any change when needed.  It is like speaking to a Stepford wife.  Amazon is increasingly insular and most definitely not ‚Äúcustomer-centered.‚Äù  I am beyond disappointed in this change away from customer service and the creation of simple scripts for the associate to use regardless of the customer‚Äôs needs or issue with Amazon.  The inability to speak to anyone who can actually understand the bigger issue and help in a real way is frustrating.  I feel devalued, unimportant, and only of interest if I might be sold something.  This is the horror of overly large corporations and the large enough populations on which they feed.  The individual is of little or no value.  I have spent several months trying to fix a very clear problem with Amazon Logistics, thinking Amazon would listen, care, and fix the problem.  Today‚Äôs experience made it clear that Amazon might listen, but to care enough to fix the real issue is not a part of the script that the associates have been given.  "

Saltrampen,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Have ordered many items from Amazon, they arrive quickly and you can track them. 90% of them have been fine, one or two a day or two late, the issues come when things go wrong or when you look at reviews. Not as stated,damaged or you need to return it , feels like an uphill struggle. Lots of small print. You have to organise the return and try to claim the postage back. Reviews: I submitted a glowing 5 star review mentioned the packaging, it got published. I submitted a 1 star review stating the packaging was so bad the goods get damaged, review rejected as they do not count the packaging ?? If your review is negative they seem to try to find ways to reject it. In Amazon's defence many other internet order companies have the same issues. But as the market leaders you would have thought they would have tried harder. The tracking has a habit of changing suddenly during the day to be earlier or later , but at least you can see it. "

Betsy R,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon delivery in Anchorage is staffed with untrained, unsupevised clowns that will most likely not deliver your package. I have filed numerous BBB complaints yet they keep hiring people off the street to handle customers purchases.  Yesterday I had package arriving and the GPS on my order showed I was the next stop. I was shocked to see the delivery vehicle drive by my house and not stop! I ran out the door and ran down the street and caught up with him 2 blocks away. I asked him why he did not deliver my package and gave him my name. He said it was damaged. No indication on my order on line that it was 'damaged' I made him show me. He had dropped my box in a puddle and it was soaked. I was furious. I made him open it. Lucky for me the items were ok.  I took them and told him to keep the box. This is NOT OK.  Two weeks ago another delivery driver delivered my package and then had lunch in my driveway!!! Cleaned out his truck in my driveway!!Amazon is hiring anyone with a drivers license and who knows who to handle our purchases. I am going to file a complaint with our State Attorney General since my requests to have USPS or Ups deliver are being ignored. "
Bruce Brown,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"******************I had an AMAZON PRIME account for the better part of 7 years. Without incident, I made online purchases, streamed digital content, and made the most of the services.In time, they were asking for more money with less perks; all of a sudden, I'm also seeing commercials for Amazon content that was initially ad free... WTH?? In any case, I let that slide.Then, packages weren't being delivered in a timely fashion, and some of the products were subpar and needed to be returned.The last straw, however, was that they blocked my account literally DAYS after renewing my Prime membership. I still have no idea why it was blocked in the first place and they still won't tell me. Not being able to order products was one issue, but the worst part of this is that I couldn't access ANYthing on my Fire-Stick including content that was paid for or ANY apps; it was rendered useless.After being redirected multiple times by telephone representatives over seas, I kept hearing the same mumbo-jumbo. ""A specialist is reviewing it"". First, I was told it would be reinstated in 24 hours---Then, it was 48 hrs.--- Then, it was 72 hrs.!!!At that point, I just said ""screw it"" and decided to cancel my membership. I'm quite happy with my ROKU device, and I've found other digital platforms that provide more adequate online shopping options."
mark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"stolen pkg,by driver. Stupidest thing I have ever seen. I ordered item from ebay, they shipped it through amazon. I did not want the pkg at this point because it was going to be a week later than they said it would be. They would not let me cancel order at ebay. Went to pay pal and explained every detail of order they gave me an instant refund. Even then merchant would not let me cancel. So when pkg arrived I told Amazon driver I refused delivery and to mark it return to sender. She tossed it back in truck with no scan. 2 hours later I get a notification from ebay that said pkg was delivered. Well it was not delivered here. At this point I can only assume the driver kept it because it has not shown up anywhere in the system. 6 different agents would not help me resolve this,they would not let me speak to a manager or to the delivery logistics team. Now the vendor and ebay think I have the pkg and it makes me look bad. Ebay also refused to help me told me it was an amazon problem. Remember the good old days when people actually did their jobs. If amazon does not fix this I will consider calling police and reporting the theft"

At the time, the product was listed as in stock with a promised shipping time of 2 days. However, after nearly a month, my order has still not shipped. Despite the website still showing that 8 units of the product are in stock, there has been no progress.I reached out to customer service on September 12, 2024, and was assured that the product would be delivered by that date. Yet, it is now September 19, 2024, and my order remains in limbo.This lack of transparency and failure to deliver the promised service is unacceptable.

I was home the entire time the app said the item was attempted to be delivered. Not only that but I live in an apartment complex with a gate. And NONE of my neighbors EVER take packages off of other people's doors. There are packages left there all the time. I called customer service to complain and get my money back, and I just got hung up on 3 times. I chatted in and they would not help me.

I've moved to a different and the courier drivers do not follow the instructions and do not deliver my orders or deliver them to a completely different address. Numerous times I have spoke with an associate either over the phone or with the online chat explaining the situation and asking why they don't follow the delivery instructions.  As a result they have now blocked my account and will only allow me to purchase digital items !! When this is a courier problem and not me as a consumer.

Anne Kane,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I submitted two items for return and refund and Amazon published information indicating that I had received a refund.  I had not received a refund.  An amount was added to a gift card (not a physical gift card, but a book entry at Amazon) but I was never told that this was the case.  I only discovered this when I went to pay my credit card and no refunds were shown.  I contacted Amazon and was told that this practice is automatic even though customers are not advised that the practice is automatic. There is nowhere that it is shown that the credit card can be credited when making a return.  I spent a great deal of time and effort taking items for return, received false statements about the status of a ""refund"" and spent even more time trying to contact Amazon.  I consider these to be deceptive practices and as such could not trust Amazon to correct its errors.  I particularly feared being required to provide any credit card information over the telephone.  I submitted this information to the CFPB and was told that they (through the Federal Trade Commission)  do not get involved with this sort of complaint, which works to the benefit of Amazon only and to the detriment of the consumers who are ostensibly to be protected.  In all, Amazon retained my money even though Amazon represented that it had issued a refund to me.  The only way to access my 'refunded' money would be to spend more money by using the 'gift' card."

Cherie Valentin,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased a new smartwatch from Amazon, and unfortunately, my experience has been less than satisfactory. While the watch arrived on time and was well-packaged, the functionality has been disappointing. The main issue is that the watch frequently loses connection with my phone, making it unreliable for notifications and fitness tracking. Additionally, the battery life is much shorter than advertised, barely lasting a full day with moderate use.The design and build quality are decent, and the watch looks stylish on the wrist. However, the performance issues overshadow these positives. I reached out to customer service for assistance, but the troubleshooting steps provided did not resolve the problems.Overall, I expected better performance from this smartwatch, especially given its price point. I would not recommend this product unless these issues are addressed in future updates or models."

They assured me that they would make up the difference in price, that I would be re-imbursed. So we cancelled and I reordered for the new price. I noticed that there was a pending charge on my CC for the full amount. Contacted them again and was told that they could not re-imburse until it was shipped. When it was shipped I contacted them again and was told they couldn't re-imburse until I received the item. After I received the item, I checked my CC account and it was still charged at full price. Contacted them again and I was told that they have no authority to re-imburse me for any reason. They were well aware of my being told differently. This scam is also reviewed on Amazon.     "

Attic Crawl,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I typically don't take the time to share reviews, but my recent experience with Amazon has been deeply frustrating and deserves to be addressed.As an HVAC business, I rely heavily on timely and reliable deliveries. I placed an order for a 16"" duct, which was crucial for one of our ongoing projects. The order came with a guaranteed delivery date that Amazon failed to meet. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach Amazon (with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options), I was forced to contact the third-party seller directly. The seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with Amazon. Despite being provided with a phone number that I could not find anywhere on Amazon‚Äôs platform, I eventually managed to speak with an Amazon representative. I was informed that the product had been lost, and while a refund was issued, the real issue remains unresolved.I need the material, not just a refund. When I attempted to reorder the product, I discovered that the price had increased by $150 ‚Äî an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances. I explained the situation to the representative, emphasizing that I had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike. In summary, my experience with Amazon has been one of misleading pricing, unreliable delivery, and a lack of customer support. This has caused significant delays for my business and damaged my relationship with my customer.I expect Amazon to resolve this by honoring the original price and ensuring the prompt delivery of the product.Sincerely,  Alex Garcia  Attic Crawl Inc."

I've had several orders never delivered and they always ask if I ""checked neighbor's homes"" etc. This is not my responsibility. My last missing order actually says the driver handed it to the resident. I live alone and was at work at the time of the delivery. They insisted that I need to wait another 24 hours to see if it mysteriously shows up. If it was still coming why do I have a tracking that says the delivery was handed to me? They are also very inconsistent with delivery times. When you call customer service they just don't care. This company is not standing behind its products or deliveries.

I need the backplate to screw it down.There is no option to actually contact support, I can either get my money back or a new product, both options require I send the product back. I do not get compensated for the expensive thermal paste of my own that I used.I'm writing this part a while later, I have sent the package back to where it came from, you can check on dhl.se this number 7135563356I also have a receipt where it said I'm returning this from DHLThey took a while to update anything, for the first nine days, it said I haven't even dropped of my package yet but I have. I got my money the next day.Don't give Amazon the benefit of the doubt like I did, just buy from websites with convinient money back policies.

Jaqi M,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"UNREAL!  To BEGIN, I USED to be a staunch Amazon 'defender'.  That became less-so when they continued to send me items which were used/returned, BROKEN, dirty, leaking, non-working, smelly, stained, dented, and just plain INCORRECT ITEMS!  (Customer for 8 years, and this started slowly about 2-3 years ago and errors have since picked up).  Still, I shopped them for the convenience, the pricing, and because I did purchase some items which I very much liked and thought of as good buys.  TODAY, however, I received an Instapot multi-cooker POT instead of the Instapot dual-basket, windowed AIR-FRYER I actually purchased.  But, that's not all.  When I phoned Amazon, I was transferred to what obviously was the FRAUD department and they asked me for a copy of my IDENTIFICATION in order to process a return and refund - which if I did not provide, I would not be eligible for a return (!!!).  Whaaaaat?  You mean to tell me that in their utter incompetence, THEY send me crappy items and THEN they want to RANSOM my refund because they think that maybe I am trying to put myself through the hassle and frustration of dealing with a return - for what exactly????  HOW absurd is that?  OH, the Air Fryer I ordered and was expecting was a few dollars CHEAPER than the multi-cooker pot thing they sent me.  Soooo, what is the angle in regard to this refund that would require my ID so as to take time out of MY day to return a MORE EXPENSIVE item?  /facedesk  ...  (To add insult to injury, as the saying goes, returns now need to be dropped off somewhere or the customer has to pay a ridiculous FEE to have it picked up, WHEN it is AMAZON that made the mistake in the first place!!! I literally loathe this company now, and hope that something comes along quickly that can upend them and show them how it's done.  I know that's a pipedream, however, because think of it:  Bezos is using ALL this money that POURS in daily, to INVEST and make MORE MONEY on/with.  Those returns-on-investment (ROI) make him RICH.  It doesn't matter that an item arrives broken, or badly manufactured, or leaking, or doesn't work, or if it's just the wrong item.  The MONEY we paid for them are IN his pocket at the time and it is growing and creating more money for him so Amazon wins regardless. What a formula!"

Aimee Aponte,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I returned a product using my Amazon Prime card, product was return and a refund should have been issued to my Prime Card, but no they went and issued me a gift card without any notification through mail, email or account. Never sent me a code or card in case I wanted to use my funds to my balance. What kind of service is that. If I would have used my bank card or any other credit card how would have my funds been returned? I went to make a quick purchase again using my prime card and the site went using my gift card without giving me an option on my card. Now that I innocently used the gift card they don‚Äôt want to send me a gift card or apply remaining balance to my account where it should have been placed from beginning. How unprofessional and frustrating this is when any time there is a return it is to be given back to the card used not how ever they chose. If I would have paid cash then yes I can understand a gift card but NO CASH WAS USED. I want my funds added to my account or a gift card sent out that can be used to make payment to my card. What horrible service Amazon is giving. "
Peter Gray,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Many orders completed with no issue. Needed a photo frame , located one, in stock,  but system flatly refused to deliver to any address or pick up and provided NO reason why. 45 minutes to find CS number - cut of twice, appaling lines, after another 45 minutes CS unable to identify issue fed up with being left on hold so ended call contacted the manufacturer direct, ordered the frame ( same price but paid a bit for delivery) and advised their sales team they could be losing sales due to Amazons system. How good any business model is is really identified and defined by how it deals with brand and customer support & issues. As a long time prime customer I am appalled at Amazons woeful system of uncontactable, cannot communicate with,  cannot understand, tick box customer support.. It is of the VERY worst kind."

Wendy Deomano,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon has the worst delivery service I have ever experienced. Their coordination and communication are severely lacking. I provided a designated delivery schedule for my order during office hours, as no one is present to receive packages at night. Despite this, they attempted to deliver my order at night when no one was available. Even worse, they threaten to leave the package outside the office. I strongly advise against leaving items unattended; it creates unnecessary risk. They continue to make promises and apologies, saying it won't happen again, yet the same issues persist. The information in the app often doesn't match reality. I placed an order, but there has been no update on my delivery, despite my follow-up inquiries. As a Prime member, my experience has been disappointing; it feels like there is no priority for members. Overall, I am incredibly frustrated by their service, and it seems that they do not care about their customers at all."

Unfiltered Unfiltered by ME,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I didn‚Äôt want to give any stars; however I gave 1 because it was the only option I had. A third party where a family member resides in Florida about 2 months ago as a favor purchased 2 items I had asked my son to purchase for me. I sent the Photographs so he would know what items they were. I didn‚Äôt have knowledge that they would both be purchased at Amazon. They were a Tough Light 400 and an Eton Emergency Radio. I only know that my son indicated that the lamp was double the price advertised, no issue with the price of the Eton Radio. The items were carefully packaged with Bubble wrap and foam and mailed to me in Puerto Rico. Upon arrival, the Tough Light 400 although it looked perfect never turned on. I followed the advice of the manufacturer and nothing worked. The radio was operating well, however I noticed that there were scuff marks on one side and the screw where the Lithium battery was looked like it had been tampered with. I called Amazon first since I didn‚Äôt have a receipt or the address where the products were shipped to. Amazon immediately responded that I had to have proof of purchase to return and that after 30 days I needed to take the issue to the manufacture. Tough Light never responded to a message I left them and after sending an email expressing the diverse issues, there position was that in order to return and replace I needed to have proof of purchase. I know that every product sold has a unique number and ToughLight could have easily verified if the product I have was sold through Amazon m. That ended the story! However, the Eton Radio was not charging properly solar or with furnished plug to charge in an electrical outlet. The response was 180 degrees from Amazon and ToughLight! I explained the predicament I was in; not having proof of purchase and not acquainted with the person who purchased the products. People are reluctant to furnish credit card information to a person they don‚Äôt know, but I am very grateful for the gesture regardless. Eton, simply requested my address and committed to sending a shipping label. After they receive the Radio, they will send a new product. Therefore, my first experience with Amazon and last‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have an exact date, however I do know the products were purchased and sent to me about a few weeks afterwards. By the time I got around to opening the package, my guesstimate is that 1 and 1/2 to 2 months time period from this date. "

jack,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought outdoor water timers for garden and yard from Amazon, and the cheaper foreign brands have failed. So did many of my plants. I read the manuals and they say that the maximum operating temperature is less than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Amazon wouldn't refund my money, I reached them by phone and told them that Amazon needed to discontinue selling products that are not rated to be used in regions that experience higher temperatures than stated in product manuals. This is going to be a huge problem in the future, plastics, electronics and other temperature sensitive outdoor products will degrade or stop working and retailers should make operating temperatures a basic factor in choosing products to sell to consumers. In 2024 Phoenix, Arizona had 64 days when temperatures were 110 or above. Lawnmowers, outdoor equipment, hoses, lawn furniture and other products will have to be modified to withstand higher temperatures or they are going to fail or wear out much sooner than in the past.

Ken Williams,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I started receiving packages from Amazon that I did not order.  I contacted Amazon with all the information and was told several things but never received a fix.  I was told they would conduct an investigation and contact me, the first several times within 7-10 days then 24-48 hours about the fourth time.  Never received a response, was even told by customer service to view it as a golden opportunity as I was receiving things I didn't order.  I received a CC bill from my CC company that is not associated with Amazon nor on my account with several charges I did not authorized.  Obviously someone got access to my CC information and was using it but Amazon did nothing to stop this.  AT&T Universal who has my CC was outstanding, reversing all the charges and issuing me a new card.  Called Amazon again to let them know about the problem and that a fraud was taking place and they could not be less interested.  If you are receiving 9 of the same paintings, 40 steak knives, 20 bottles of soap and many other items in the same amounts someone in the Amazon fraud department should take notice.  They didn't care than and don't care now even when the CSR admits the items and amounts are obviously an attempt at fraud.  I'm good and my CC company will get their money back from Amazon and Amazon just really doesn't seem to care either way so guess they make so much money that issues like this just are not a concern.  Make sure you check all your accounts not just the ones you have linked to your Amazon account.  They will not help you."

Tobias,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"While I've generally been pleased with the products I've purchased from Amazon, their handling of product reviews is incredibly frustrating. Recently, I invested my time to write thoughtful and positive reviews for two separate products, only to have Amazon remove them without a clear explanation. The communication I received indicated a violation of their community guidelines, though these guidelines are so extensive that it's unreasonable to expect customers to sift through them to determine the precise issue.This isn't just a minor annoyance; it directly affects the sellers whose high-quality products are worthy of praise, but now lack the positive feedback they have earned due to a seemingly capricious review system. Further aggravating the situation is the unhelpful customer service that provides no meaningful guidance on correcting the supposed issues with my reviews.Despite my appreciation for the value of the products I purchased, the deficient and opaque review process, coupled with a customer service team that gives no definitive answers, has led me to the point of exasperation. Consequently, I am no longer inclined to dedicate my time to crafting new reviews. Instead, I find myself compelled to voice my discontent here. Amazon, unfortunately, has earned this negative feedback due to their lackluster service and unfavorable approach to customer and seller relations."

Louize Turner,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchase a lot from Amazon being easy for next day delivery and they always have what you want.  The street I live in is ..... Street leading to ...... street  hence there is 2 streets with the same door number.  The delivery drivers get confused and often deliver it to the wrong house.  I have gone to the other house in numerous occasions and been advised they do not have any parcels for me.  The photos of the delivery are not even of my property or that of the other house with the same number.  im sure the drivers have stock photos.. Anyway.  upon contacting Amazon I am more or less accused of steeling due to the amount of missed parcels and me requesting refunds or replacement.  I received an email with their return policy.  Again making me out to be an untruthful person and basically i found this quite offensive.  I reluctantly purchase  from them now and receive delivery to a locker ensuring that I receive them.  The 2 nearest lockers are in the Co-op shops that close at 9.00pm. This can be difficult to do when you work shifts.  Basically my complaint is the delivery drivers need to take more care.  Plus, Amazon should look into this and not accuse customers of being untruthful. ... Rant Over.. Sorry !!!"

All I can think is they are part of this scam the specific vendor is runningYou removed all my reviews because I warned people about a vendor and I have a letter from postmaster general and the fraudulent label to prove they committed mail fraud and also to get vengeance for leaving a truthful review about a shoddy product charged me and sent me the same product a week after I returned it. I've never given anything but accurate honest reviews and if you're going to start silencing customers I'm filing a complaint with BBB and letting everyone on social media know. Postmaster showed me the labels they use are created on Photoshop and then customer has to pay $12.43 for shipping cause the seller didn't pay the postage. The postmaster contacted the authorities because what the vendor is doing is a FEDERAL OFFENSE. NOT TO MENTION, I never ordered a 2nd pair and they not only charged me for them but then I had to pay postage. Same thing happened with 1st order. I returned those and only. Got back something like $12 which didn't even cover the postage. You need to stop silencing customers who have valid warnings and only. Post truthful reviews. I will not take the horrible way you've been treating me, freezing my account and now removed every review i ever posted plus I'll never be allowed to post a review again. I'm filing a complaint with BBB because your reasoning is unfounded and If I need to I will file a lawsuit for discrimination. You have a vendor scamming customers and rather than protect them you elect to allow it continue. Another way Amazon is proving they hold all the power and Americans are at the conglomerates mercy Will post a picture of the label when I get it from my mother's car tomorrow which proves this vendor is running a scam and Amazon is allowing it"

Chris G,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Our company, Herbal Spirits, designed and sold herbal blends that were designed to help people quit smoking addictive, nicotine-filled tobacco cigarettes.

In addition, Amazon deactivated a completely separate corporation's account for being ""related"" even though it had violated none of Amazon's policies. As a result, that business has also lost the majority of it's revenue, and it now facing bankruptcy. All of the families employed by this business are facing unemployment now. After hiring an attorney to appeal to Amazon's legal team, Amazon responded that selling Marshmallow Leaf on their website is fatal to reinstatement of the accounts, even though a quick search on their marketplace reveals that plenty of sellers are still selling products that contain Marshmallow Leaf. This unfair treatment of our businesses reveals that Amazon is clearly in support of addictive substances such as nicotine-filled tobacco cigarettes, and is also in favor of destroying family owned businesses to maintain their dominance of the online retail marketplace. This is also a violation of anti-trust laws. Amazon is a very EVIL monopoly, with a stranglehold on the online retail marketplace, and they should be avoided at ALL COSTS."
Rita Mae,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Horrible horrendous company. Amazon Fresh just delivered damaged products and expired item and refuse to refund me unless I send pictures. They keep delivering my order and not following instructions. I‚Äôm going to Walmart delivery service if they don‚Äôt get it together. This is so frustrating!

Rebecca,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I can‚Äôt fault their delivery service. From the purchases I‚Äôve made I‚Äôve had one occasion where they sent the wrong item.  They were fantastic in lockdown and still continue the same service. Customer service is excellent too 
jj,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No problem ordering from Amazon. They make the process simple and its quick and effective. However the delivering of goods is ridiculous. I have had 2 deliveries in the past 2 days. I physically watched the driver leave his van and walk up the path. He could not see me. I waited for the door to go but nothing happened although i did see the colour of the delivery guys jacket heading back down the close stairs. I assumed it must have been a delivery for next door and thought no more of it for 5 minutes. Then my phone went to tell me my package was delivered!!!! News to me so I opened the door and in the middle of my step was my package. The driver made no attempt to ring the bell or knock the door and the same thing happened with yesterdays delivery.If this happens again the item will be returned to amazon for a full refund as i am not in the habit of buying things with a huge risk attached on whetheri receive it or not.I called amazon customer services who were more interested in getting me to jump through hoops than help. After doing all the account verification before speaking to the advisor she was unwilling to help unless i went through all the security again. Pathetic. No wonder so many people are upset with the way Amazon go about their business. I now understand fully. 
Cid,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Amazon are thief‚Äôs. I brought ¬£50 worth of stuff and they took my money. I have proof on my bank statement but apparently the money is stuck in thin air.

MacEanruig,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate how pointless it may be to review a behemoth company like Amazon but it appears that consumers are powerless to prevent companies like this defrauding them.  Unless of course you refuse to use them.  I have read about fake Amazon reviews in the press, but today has been the first time I've experienced it.  An item I found via Google search was listed on Amazon. On further inspection it became clear that all of the reviews are fake.  It also became clear that every other item sold by this Amazon merchant were also fake.  To make matters worse, all items are being supplied directly by Amazon making them wholly complicit in this fraud.  Complaining directly to Amazon is impossible as there appears to be no way to do so and their AI chat bots only provide very specific topics to contact them about, fraud not being one of them.  If you are using Amazon, please be aware of this.  Check out MISOSU Direct Shop for example fake reviews, they all start with some made up problem that the item has been given 5 stars for resolving."
Wayne Smart,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"What a horrible experience with amazon where they refuse refund you when you bought an item, they send you the wrong item out and when it comes to getting a refund they just keep saying 7days. Now this item wasn't even the same brand, was a cheap 16inch one where mine was 18 inch monster not going into detail of how much but it was expensive. If you been in the same situation before what did you do because I'm getting no where. I've also spoken to them on the phone and they hung up on me, twice. This conversation has happened every 7 days since the 16th July, just going round in circles."

I never use Amazon because of a bad experience several years ago (Hair Dryer burst into flames and Amazon didn't want to know). However, my daughter has used Amazon consistantly, being reasonably satisfied. However, experience this week has changed her opinion. She ordered a Power Washer. When it arrived, the cardboard box it was in appeared to have been opened and very roughly resealed. On opening the box, two of the main components were missing, namely the gun and handle. On phoning Amazon, we were told that we had to deal directly with the supplier. Complaining about this, after over 40 minutes on the phone, we got a promise of a refund. We asked for that to be confirmed in an email. Email arrived stating we had to deal directly with supplier! Phoned back but got nowhere. You would have thought that, considering the disgraceful condition the Washer was delivered in, Amazon would have wanted to be involved."

Maebell Jordan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The drivers do not read the delivery instructions. I have had 2 delivery attempts for not having access to the building. Had they read the delivery instructions I would have my package delivered. Drivers are doing what they want and thats the bare minimum when they clearly do not read instructions. The first time i contacted customer service, Meera was very unhelpful. The attempt was at 5am and the package could have been redelivered same day. All they asked was would I prefer a refund or to replace the items. In order to get them redelivered I chose to replace them.I had to contact customer service again due to drivers incompetency of not following simple directions. The second cutomer service rep,Sanika helped tremendously. Instead of replacing it or refunding the money this rep actually got ahold of the department so that my package can be delivered by end of day. I will update if my package still is not delivered. "

Ron Pigott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I recently purchased an item from Amazon listed as ‚Äúmozzie milk‚Äù  125ml at a purchase price of ¬£17.50 + ¬£5.90 for post and packing. The item I received is a different product  in a 100ml container. The item was to be delivered from a third party supplier. Yet my contract is indisputably with Amazon. Navigating the click box returns process is straight forward unless there is an anomaly. In my case it appears I have to pay for the return and do not get a refund on the post and packaging. After several hours of exploring ways to have an interactive exchange with a human being have all been closed down by Amazon. It claims to have a chat box but clicking the link simply takes you back to square one in a never ending circle. Listed email addresses have all been returned as ‚Äú undeliverable‚ÄùI managed to find an 0800 number through Wikipedia which is accompanied by a warning to expect very long waiting times. Amazon have clearly decided to block any communication with customers who they appear to hold as contemptible. I find this morally reprehensible and will not be using Amazon again.

They converted a purchase refund to their gift card (which is an account credit not an actual gift card) then use that as a consumer rights get around to keep your money. I have not received the goods ordered as it was damaged a delivered damaged, returned, then the replacement wash machine was damaged in transit and returned before I even received it. They say no replacement is available and refused to refund. And have placed the money into their so called gift card system so you can only buy from them. This has been going on for at least two months now and I want my money back to purchase a washer elsewhere. So at the moment they have my ¬£335.

Only crazy people can buy from this store.There are so many things wrong here, that I don't have space, they need to shutdown this horrible immediately, stop stealing people, it's enough!People giving positive reviews or are fake or don't understand nothing of nothing! OK you buy, you receive and many times it's fast and If I want a refund they give no issues, that's it? You still don't get it? How amazon they work? They only want your money, and offcourse you came again, and recommend to others, but they are hidden their dark secrets, for they refund you, they stole the money from the sellers, because they can do whenever they want, they have the monopoly. Also because of their bad practices they are paying millions to regulators, because they don't follow the law in nothing! This is trash.For example do you know, they go to your card in your account, and without your permission they make debits? So give your card to these thiefs, they are the best shop in the world, they refynd and ship fast, and you are happy to be cheated by the most expensives prices of the planet? Yes they put there msny cheap products to cheat you, make you they are cheap, but less them 5% of their catalogue have a good price just to cheat you, all orders products can be 100x times cheaper everywhere! Open the eyes! They have debited my cards so many times without my permission, I considered if I don't checked I will be stolen, they don't have shame to do that? In Amazon this is normal for them. And for example delivery time? They say you will be refunded if item don't arrives in time, them when time arrives, they say you need await more 3 days them 1 week, them only after that you can ask refund?? What are a cheaters, liars? And they duplicate my orders, oh my god this is number one website of scamners, and also their website it's only well made, it's full of errors, bugs, looks a shop by children's nothing there makes sense.

Sean H,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"I've been loyally using Amazon for around ten years now, but my experience with it in 2024, especially within the last two or three months, has been absolutely dreadful. The two most common complaints I have to give, and the most annoying -1. Orders being delayed or outright being lost. I had an order that was out for delivery, then it kept being delayed until I was told it would arrive by 10pm, then it was delayed by two days, and the same thing just happened but this time delayed by four days. How can an order be OUT FOR DELIVERY and then end up being delayed by days?2. The refund system. I was told by an automated service that I'd be refunded for said cases above, but the system then told me I'd be refunded once the items are returned. I contacted one of the agents and questioned how can I return something that didn't arrive, and thankfully they agreed and refunded me. I don't know what's changed internally, but Amazon used to have reliable delivery and a reliable refund system. In the past months it's just completely gone downhill. I won't be using them from here on out for a while. Do yourself a favour and use one of the many alternatives that now exist, there are plenty of great websites out there that are currently much better. Update 06/02/25 - Had no issues with it for a while now. Items have been arriving on time and sometimes even earlier, couriers are knocking and waiting, any slight issues have been dealt with efficiently. I can‚Äôt comment for anyone else but for me personally, I‚Äôm enjoying using it again. "

I am getting sick of not getting this resolved and no one from Amazon can fix their auto generated refund system to refund my return.  Amazon makes sure to charge you the minute it ships out but does not care enough for their customer service to refund when it is shipped back.  I am highly disappointed with Amazons lack to help get me my refund due to their computer glitch.
Bea Mudryk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a breadmaker from Amazon Canada site, it was defective so I called Amazon customer service and was told that they would send a message to a third party seller and I should hear back from him within 48 hours. He sent a return label in which I would have to pay over 30.00 to ship back as well as a restocking fee. I again called Amazon and again they said they would take care of. This time the seller would not respond after 48hours. Again I was told it would be taken care of. The next day I got an email telling me the breadmaker was stolen and I would have to get a police report to them I stressed that I had several conversations with them already about this breadmaker and it was not stolen.  The next day I received the same email saying I need the police report.  I called again. This time in complete frustration. A john came on and then said I would need to deal with the seller to resolve now. Or he could put a certain percentage on my Amazon account if I kept the breadmaker.  What??? All I wanted as a consumer was to return a defective item and have my money returned. I received a message today from their A Z department that my claim was denied.

customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I cannot believe that I am actually moved to call AMAZON a bunch of SCAMMERS.  I placed an order for an item yesterday evening.  It was on a price offer until midnight and would be delivered the next day (today).  I just happened to look at my orders and saw that it would, now, not be delivered for another TWENTY FOUR DAYS.  On the order page, I clicked on the image of the item - read that again slowly, ON THE  ORDER  PAGE,  I  CLICKED  ON  THE  IMAGE  OF  THE  ITEM  and it took me back to it, SHOWING THAT I HAD BOUGHT IT THE DAY BEFORE but it was now back to its original price AND WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY.  I called amazon to query this and was told that I could cancel the order re-place it and my item would arrive the next day.  But, of course, I would have to pay the higher price.  No amount of arguing seemed to be able to answer the question of how EXACTLY the same item can be delivered next day at the higher price, but at the offer price I paid the previous day I would have to wait over three weeks.  Insanity.  I demanded to speak to the agent's supervisor and, after more arguing, I was put through.  The supervisor, after more arguing and trying to get through to him the ridiculousness of the situation, was magnanimous enough to offer me the difference in a gift card if I cancelled and re-placed the order.  I don't want an effing gift card, I want the item at the price I paid and with the delivery time advertised on the listing at the time I paid for it.  Is that too much to ask?  What they did, by anyone's definition, was a SCAM and I have now deleted my account."

Lorna Morton ,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"I like Amazon. It has a lot of selection and you can usually get what you need from there. They have some good offers on there if you get them at the right time. Otherwise, it can be a little dearer than on the high street. You have to be careful with some of the cosmetic products, they‚Äôre not always legit. But they are really taking the p**s with the minimum spend if you‚Äôre not a prime member. It‚Äôs been hiked from ¬£25 to ¬£35 ü§¨. Ridiculous!! "
Bill Wynne,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"1.7 Rating at this time of this review, really? I have no problems with Amazon. There is a huge selection, the price is generally lower but not always, shipping is great, and returning things is easy. I am very concerned about Alexa though, it is extremely biased, which is a huge concern as people stop doing research and rely on these devices to tell them what is ""truth.""I would also add that allowing Chinese products that follow neither the metric nor standard measuring systems should be indicated in a list or else the seller gets a warning. "
Ryan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They deserve a lawsuit really. They have lied about items and returning items. I have spent countless hours on the phone with them. It is a scam.
Duck Sucker,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If you write a truthful review of poor service on Amazon it will be censored, I've gotten total crap and they wouldn't allow my reviews to be posted"
Las Vegas VIP Limousines,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered August 30th, the first one, for an elderly relative who can no longer hear the phone ring. Nurses cannot get a hold of him daily. Amazon said ""It got lost"", then empty promises from Amazon Customer Service and Supervisors. Waited and then decided to order another on Amazon. My profile specifically says ""Open 730 AM to 900 PM"". That Delivery person tried at 612 AM. HELLO READ YOUR INSTRUCTIONS PS, that one is now lost, again Amazon Customer Service is useless...‚Ä¶..""3rd Time They Said Tomorrow"" It is now September 5, 2024 - Think they exceeded their business model. Walmart, Target and eBay are quicker and now carry almost everything. "
Ted Bowen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I used to like Amazon a lot, in their early years they couldn't be beat because of their quality of service, but things have really changed in my opinion, and they keep getting worse.For the 3rd time this year I've had an order get delayed.  I understand that that's part of mail-ordering... but there's always somethings that are ""hinky"" about the delays. For instance, I received a confirmation 20 hours ago that the items had just shipped and that I could expect them today. Just now, I received a delay notice that it ""should"" arrive in 5 days. (How did it get delayed overnight?) And the other delays were similarly nonsensical.I've worked in shipping & receiving positions a lot, in my career days, so I get that odd things can happen, in fact odd can be rather normal in the ""business"". So, I'm unconvinced that the reasons behind any of my recent delayed shipments were the ""normal sort of odd"".The thing with Amazon and their sellers is that there's a rather long waiting period when an item gets delayed before they'll consider it lost and grant a refund or whatever. Also, they don't take the loss/delay seriously like they used to do back in the day. And to add to that, there's really no place on the Amazon site to comment about their site (as if they care about the customer) ... I've always hated looking at the reviews about an item, only to read about shipping issues... now I understand why.So, a month or so ago, I quit Amazon Prime because paying for better shipping privileges when the shipping services were cruddy didn't make sense. But what am I to do when I want to quit this corporate juggernaut that we've built... they pretty much own the market."
Harley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I pay for prime and expidited shipping. Most of the time I do not get shipping when promised. I have had packages come as far off as a week to get when promised 2 day shipping. Amazon has zero customer support. If you attempt to get support you get sent to a Q&A page. They do not return messages.
Sharon Lowery,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ordered item yesterday said would be delivered by 1 pm today then today it says between 5 and 9 pm why tell lies , its not the first time this has happened , quick enough to take the money then delay the products !!!!"
Jean Ganzaroli,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I did a purchase of a type C charger cable ¬£9.98 on 20Th of August 2024 ! The money was withdrawn from my bank account but on my Amazon account everything has disappeared !! I lost my money , Amazon doesn‚Äôt find it !! On My Amazon account says I haven‚Äôt done any purchases on the last 3 months but I did 2 on August 1 on July The service call back isn‚Äôt working! No one care for it !!!"
Lulu xoxo,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Amazing selection and fast delivery. Overall, very satisfied!"
James Phelps,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"All of a sudden after years with Amazon, they arbitrarily decided that they need some kind of verification for the debit card I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS! I am cancelling everything I can with this company. They have done nothing but complicate my purchasing. NO MORE AMAZON FOR ME!"
Muhammad Kabeer,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is a good platform i buy so many things like charger, shirts, shoes but sometimes my experience is bad sometimes my experience is to good "
Margherita,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I use Amazon on weekly basis and is a good service except for Prime that is no more as it was in the past. Very often there is no difference between prime and normal delivery time
MOUNIR MOURACADE,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This review is about AMAZON deliveries not, shopping.You can write all the deliveries instruction you want, the drivers cannot read. I hace cancelled and $700.00 delivery after they tried to deliver to a BUSINESS (office) after five o√ßlock on a friday. Unfortunately, it is not the first time and it will happen again."
Stephen Starling,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Your agent is a damn liar. Said you can't lock accounts, well mine was locked for 2 months and I'm not dumb i took screen shots and videos of me trying to log into my account and it saying it was locked and all of the hassle i went through and stuff i had to keep sending in to prove i am who i say i am and finally got my account back, then go to say that i didn't get one of my packages only for him to say its been 2 months and that's to long so i explain that my account was locked and that my lawyer will be contacting you and i will be suing and going for his job for lying because before i could even tell him i have actual screen shots and videos of my account being locked and everything i had to do and send in to have my account unlocked he hung up on me. I have several others at least 30-50 people that has had the same issues with this so I'm contacting my lawyer today one everyone emails me their proof too and we are definitely taking this to court and also bringing up the fact that you charge us for faster delivery but never get it on that day ever so that's false advertising, fraud, and theft. So, he just screwed the whole Amazon company baby being the way he was. All because i was very polite and tried explaining and only wanted the $30 red put on many Amazon gift card balance so that i could even still purchase from you, but he wanted to be an punk and not listen over $30 which will be costing you a whole lot more."
Karen,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon is absolute rubbish.  Forces you to create an amazon account to use the apps on the TV, then blocks the account to verify payment details. You submit the details then they tell you that you have to wait 2 days to have access to the apps on the TV again.  Cannot watch Netflix, YouTube nothing because the amazon account has taken over everything on the TV which is blocked.  What a joke!!!  Deserves no stars at all for such incompetence. "

Barry Herscovitch,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,When calling the customer service number they refused to transfer me to an English speaking representative in the USA.  When communicating on the online chat the reps could not understand English and just type in responses that are not quite relevant to my issue. They even promised the order would arrive on 8/30/2024 and as of 9/4/2024 it still has not arrived. I asked them to inform me where the order is located and they could not. All this in writing. Why do they lie about arrival dates and yet keep their jobs????? I requested to speak to a supervisor and I was told they don‚Äôt have one‚Ä¶ what crick of crap!!
Greg Geddes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have an Amazon points credit card.it collects points but Amazon can't or won't link it to their site so I can redeem the points....over two months ago and several times since I have tried to get this fixed but they keep telling me soon. I was at one time told ..no worries it fill be fixed in 48 hrs...a month ago...called the bank no help...so canceling the card and quiting prime...thier movies are a sad selection anyway  and If you want to see anything good you need to subscibe and pay another site....
Michael Farmer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Amazon sent me the wrong order 2 times, the same items. I contacted them to avoid this negative review. We made a deal and they reneged. I contacted them again to discuss it and the rep was arrogant, non-empathetic, and hung up on me. This of course will hurt my trading with them. Amazon has become too big to care about its customers and acts like no one matters. Let this be a lesson to us all. Buy from an Amazon competitor!!!"
Mr JTB,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The prices on amazon.com are excellent. They ship things quickly and will reimburse someone for any mistakes they make. I‚Äôve not a clue as to why anyone would rate this website lower than four stars.
Gnyff,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely terrible user experience in EU!3-6 month delivery time on standard items ""dispatched by Amazon""?!And IMPOSSIBLE to get in contact with ""customer service"" (probably they have no such thing!)Furthermore the site is flooded with Chinese crap - and I'm not sure how to see what is copies and what is real branded products.Update Sep.6th: Although Amazon still completely ignores me they have now seemingly shipped the majority of the order - so only one item remains with looong delivery time. At least that indicates to me that /someone/ is reading the feedback and is indeed considering it. I'll give them a star based on that assumption alone..."
Michal Aniol,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst service 
BARBARA CON,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The deliberate sale of defective merchandise, accompanied by an effort to shifting the burden of responsibility onto the purchaser is a criminal offense, this constitutes a fraudulent business practice. This scenario involves third-party sellers dispatching damaged products to buyers while the principal company, and Amazon is known foe its fraudulent business practices, it's  imperative that such entities are held accountable for their deceptive conduct, and consumers should be wary of engaging with companies that employ these unethical strategies. The liability for the defect and the associated return costs should unequivocally fall upon the seller or platform, not the buyer and as a buyer you have the right to refuse any  liability that's associated with afraudulent business practice and stop patronizing AMAZON until their policy is revised in consideration of all consumer laws and must benefit your interest as a consumer.Your foreign representatives are extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. My family has maintained on Amazon account for over 5 years!!!"
Dave,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"tried to update my phone number twice online, failed twice. Called C S and told 3 times I needed to call back cuz they couldn't find my account though it's been active for years.  The have barely english speaking reps who don't know how to solve problems.  it's a waste of time trying to get anything done.  moving on."
