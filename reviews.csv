LagToScam,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,hay day has been really fun to play lately and ive been playing it every day for 2 months now most people say in app purchases are a scam but see it as a better way to spend your money then gambling i gladly spend 200€ a month on supercell games because they don't scam you and their support is always there to help as for hay day i really hope you could add indicators to see wich people of your neighborhood are online and another great function would be that you could designate certain spots in your roadside shop to your neighborhood only so regular people dont steal the items before your friends get to them. i hope theres many more years of hay day and keep up the good work
Ian Wooller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I cannot change the Members in Clan War League and as usual Supercell have done nothing.
James Rolf,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Brawl Pass for my son on 4 June 2025. It didn’t activate or show in-game, so I assumed it had failed and requested a refund. I then repurchased the pass the next day, and it worked correctly.Despite still paying full price, the account was penalised -4800 gems as if we had received something for free — which we hadn’t. I’ve provided receipts and asked support repeatedly to check the logs, but they just send the same scripted response.If Supercell sees this, I’m happy to provide full details. We’re not asking for anything free — just for a penalty to be removed that shouldn’t be there."
Ewelina,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I spent over £XXX on Squad Busters, only to realise I was trapped in an aggressive and manipulative spending cycle. The game uses deceptive offers, inconsistent pricing, and deliberately confusing mechanics to get you hooked, then punishes you for progressing.The biggest scam? League Points resets. At the start of every season, your progress is either halved or reset to 4,000 trophies, regardless of how much you earned (or paid) to reach 10,000+. This isn’t a “competitive balance”, it’s a clever tactic to make you grind again and spend more just to regain what you already had. There’s zero transparency or warning in-game. You just log in and everything’s gone.When I raised concerns, I was given generic, copy-paste replies. I provided all 40+ transaction receipts for a refund request (due to a major update that ruined the gameplay experience), and they refunded only two transactions, totalling less than £15. The rest? Ignored. They passed the buck to Google, then claimed they ""can’t help with multiple refunds"" unless I close my account permanently.That’s blackmail, not customer support.This game preys on dopamine loops, withholds transparency, and has zero accountability for the money you spend. It’s designed to drain your wallet with just enough rewards to keep you from leaving, until you realise you've been scammed.I regret every penny I gave to Supercell. I will never support another one of their titles again, and I urge other players to stay away or demand accountability."
SilkeFighter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrible game developing company that is made to grab as much cash off of it's users without acknowledging that the 'f2p' player base is getting left in the dust and demolished by those who spend countless amounts of money.(Clash Royale, by the way). The prices in the shop and basically everywhere in the game, are absolutely insane. Your money is worth nearly nothing in this game, and in this entire company basically.Furthermore, the balancing in the game, and perhaps in all of their games, is absolutely awful. Instead of nerfing cards that need to be nerfed and buffing where needed, they rework and nerf the most random cards that are barely ever used in player's decks. Each new card that they release, if they even release a new card, is just made to be even more unbalanced than the card released before. This way, it's just an endless cycle of making cards unbalanced and balancing them by releasing something that is even worse in terms of balancing.It seems like Supercell just completely ignores this fact, rather sad.In my opinion, it's best to not even play the games at all anymore, and if you consider spending money, don't even think about it. From what I've read, Supercell likes to scam their users who spend money in case something goes wrong, and you are likely next to get scammed. After all, the entire company and it's games are a massive scam."
Jamie osborne,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've played clash of clans for 10 years and spent a lot of money, 2 days ago supercell suspended my account for 7 days because I joked with my clan mates saying I was going to sell my account. Absolutely disgraceful. The only company that will ban you for joking with friends."
Anton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I haven’t been able to play for a week now because support isn’t answering. They should really let players stop the account deletion on their own
Dini Muetter,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’m writing this because Supercell made a simple situation unbearable. I paid for an in-game digital item. They took the money. I never received the product.I contacted their support multiple times. No resolution. I reached out to their legal inbox with a formal message referencing contract law and GDPR. I received a canned auto-reply — then silence.So I escalated the right way:I filed with SECO (Swiss consumer authority)I filed with KKV (Finnish consumer authority)I submitted a GDPR Article 15 data access requestSupercell ignored all of it. Not a single human response.Now I’m posting this because they don’t deserve to hide behind silence while I get buried in automated emails. I’m not asking anymore. I’m exposing.Every ignored message is now evidence. Every comment they delete gets screenshotted. And I’ll keep posting until they answer or the regulators enforce it for them.If you’re considering spending money in one of their games — don’t. If anything breaks, they will ghost you too.This is the only way to be heard."
Anthony Dean,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell ID (2 parts)After reviewing Clash of Clans (CoC) you need to remember that it comes in 2 parts - the game itself (CoC) and Supercell ID.I've been gaming since the Atari days, so I've played them all.The game is great at first and highly addictive, so you find yourself buying from the Clash Shop to improve your standing. Especially if you're playing this interactively online, which I've been doing for a month now. (I've spent $150)After a month of SERIOUS playing time, I realised that perhaps it would be a good idea to 'preserve' my progress and investment.You're supposed to do this in-app, but I couldn't open the Supercell ID icon or change the 'disconnected' button, which would've allowed me to do this (supposedly).Of course I tried to reach out to the Support and Help team, who's advice led to the complete loss of my data, progress and investment.THEY ACTUALLY ASSIGNED THE CHANGES TO AN UNKNOWN USER! I've checked the User Groups and Chat Rooms - this is a systemic problem.Now here's the rub and it's a HUGE issue.If such ineptitude exists; what real protection is there from scammers, hackers and data miners?CoC and Supercell ID are digitally linked together, hand in glove.In conclusion the problems the game makers have is the Supercell ID issue. It appears open to serious misuse and possible criminal activity. "
Game Boy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Hiring the worst, untalented product and tech people building the wrong mechanics and focusing on worthless visual optics to attract downloads and users. They're a company whose products flourish on undiscerning kids. I've played games for more than a decade, extremely poor understanding of game balances. "
Christopher Allison Chris,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell has to be one of the worst gaming developers ever. Their games are always glitchy and when you attempt interaction with their support staff, you realize they care about no one. Not their customer or even about their games, and game stability. They are money hungry and completely incompetent. Support staff knowingly lies to you. That is if you can get them to even respond. Worst Game providers period. "
Alex Low,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Game is good but you need to spend money if you had play quite a bit on it
Brenden Jennings,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My account got hacked (changed my email so I nolonger have access) and the only support they offer is an automated chat which inevitably ends every conversation with ""Unfortunately, we cannot proceed withyour recovery as we were unable to verifythat you are the original owner of this ac-count.Ive had this game for over 10 years and I understand it's just a game at the end of the day but I put alot of time and effort into this and the fact there's no help is very frustrating. It's been over a week now with no hope of recovering my account. I have lots of information to prove that this is indeed my account including clanmates who can confirm my situation as well as all of the account information."
tangledgaming,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Freak(cant use non pg version) supercell ruined clash royale
Ayan Islam,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"WORST SUPPORT IN THE WORLD. 1. Never responds in less than 12 hours2. The respond you get is automated, meaning that they don’t actually read your request 3. You are blocked from support if they lock your account. This may seem normal, but they say to unlock your account, YOU MUST contact support. Here is my situation: I just want to change my email as I don’t have access to the current one, so they say ‘contact support.’ When I do, it says one of your game accounts are locked, completely automated with utter disregard of my request. Supercell ID ≠ Game Accounts. And they say, “We checked your game accounts connected from the SuperCell ID you contacted from,” And then they ask “Contact form the supercell ID you are talking about so we can prove it is you.” WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HELL. If they read my request, they would know I said “the supercell account I am contacting from.” They are the worst support in the world, and the company just wants money, and does not CARE about their play base."
Aaron Bradley,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,WORST COMPANY EVER!!! TAKES ADVANTAGE OF YOU BY TAKING YOUR MONEY WITHOUT CONSENT AND YHRN AS USUALLY DOESN’T THINK THEY NEEX CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! RuN DONT WALM AWAY FROM THIS COMPANT
K H,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I'd give a 0 if I could. NO support whatsoever. You create an account and spend money and then if you have any issues you're just out of luck. Waste of money and time. Had I known i would never have started an account. How are they still able to provide games and take money from anyway. They should be out of business.
Ahmed Abbkar,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Gotta be one of the worst supports ever. They always get back to you late. And almost never reply they also don’t have an live chat. They reply via email with a bot because these shit of supercell support people just want money and don’t give an actual shit about players
Miguel Cordeiro,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Create something like a mechanism that can ban daryl and kit on the same team i lost 10 trophys because of that team
Tom,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have sent multiple Emails to support for help with my account deletion which was two years ago and still haven’t gotten further than an SI response 
Tobi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Mehrmal durch ein Bug das falsche Evolution Pack in Clash Royal gekauft, Support hilft nicht und sagt zu mir  ""I am sorry to hear that you got the wrong pack. It is not unusual for mistakes like this to happen, even if the pack you got is good.Unfortunately at this moment, purchase swaps are not a supported function in the store.The Mega Knight pack is a great one, however, if you wish to purchase the Evolution pack, you will have to purchase it again.""Hier wird man nicht geholfen, sondern nur abgezogen."
Ian Wooller,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I asked supercell for my ID and as per usual NOTHING happens. My advice is to sack the bunch of them and get people in who ACTUALLY do something. Now they REFUSE to provide me with the Supercell ID's for the remaining 9 accounts saying I need to provide proof of purchase. I have NEVER purchased anything from you and the email addresses can be cross referenced by me as I would be the only one who can log into the supporting ones.
Benjamin Spitzer,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Good, the support helped with all my problems "
Landon Daniel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Their automated support system is nothing great. If you have anything related to getting an account back it can’t do anything to help you at all. It’ll say detail me how you lost your account, after doing so it says sorry there is not enough for me to verify the account is yours. I told them what the first name of the account was and other names I had with village. I told them how I lost it and I even had screenshots of my base. Not once did I ever get an actual person to help it was all automated. The automated support just says try logging in with google play or apple, even after I have pointed out I physically can not sign in with google play because I changed from android to apple, and the account had never been linked to an Apple ID. Thanks for nothing supercell"
van Damme,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Dear Supercell Support Team,I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to request assistance with recovering my daughter Maybel’s Brawl Stars account.Recently, we had to change our Google Family account, resulting in the blocking of our children’s email addresses by Google since they are minors. We successfully converted four of our children’s accounts to new email addresses with Brawl Stars’ support, but we encountered an issue with Maybel’s account.Two days ago, I reached out through in-game support and was assisted by Sebastian. He blocked Maybel’s account to facilitate the email change, but when I attempted to upload a purchase receipt, I lost connection and the game restarted. Since the account was already blocked, I couldn’t log back in to continue the chat.Now, I’m in a situation where my in-game support attempts often lead to automated responses that can’t assist me, and emails to Supercell support haven’t resolved the issue either.I can provide proof of Maybel’s account, including her Supercell ID, account name, trophies, and PayPal purchase receipts.Could you please assist me in changing Maybel’s email address ? resolving this would be greatly appreciated.- player id: LoudMaybelle- name: ayla- Trophees: 15539 (current state)- #JUJYQC9GU- many braw passes are bought through PaypalI tried many times through ingame support and email.

Anonymous,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been struggling with account recovery for years now, and the customer support from Supercell has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite following every step in their recovery process and reaching out multiple times, my issue has not been resolved. My account, which was linked to both Gmail and Facebook before Supercell ID, was banned, and I have no idea why.I’ve tried to contact support through the in-game help feature, but nothing has worked. It’s incredibly disheartening to feel ignored after investing so much time and effort into my account. The lack of meaningful communication and assistance is absolutely disappointing.Supercell needs to do better. Their support is slow, unresponsive, and doesn’t seem to prioritize issues like mine, despite being a long-time player. I feel like, unless you're willing to spend money, they don't care about you at all. They only seem interested in taking your money, not in providing proper customer support."
Archie Jupe,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Firstly they delete any bad reviews on the App Store and only reserve the good reviews for the front page the games they produce are PURELY FOR YOUR MONEY and not for your entertainment they will set you up with hard counters on games like clash royale as they have an AI bot which is made to read counters most of the AI players know how to beat you constantly and easily games like clash of clans which used to be free to play are slowly becoming p2w as they are increasing the price and time of upgrading ur towers walls everything and then they spam you with in game purchase “deals” for money to buy instant upgrades for walls and buildings they keep adding higher town hall levels but don’t add enough features for them to be any worth achieving and town hall 17 seems to be slightly weaker than 16 which is honestly ridiculous 
Alexandre Cournoyer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This company does not care about you only your money.  I have had problems with my in game name and after a week it is not resolved.  A bot keeps replying the same thing over and over yet my name falls is ok.  You can never talk to a actual person.  They made it so you will never have actual support.  Supercell is a horse shit company they have lost me forever.
Yillo Yillo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The support is just a joke team. I have been trying to recover my account for a week. They were offline for five days initially.  After I proved my ownership, they sent a verification code to my new email.  Following verification, they were supposed to email account recovery instructions, but they haven't. They are unable to send the email. Joke support "

Darren Flowers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I loved Clash of Clans. Had an account since day one. Set it up with my company email address, because hey, who needs personal emails when you’re in a virtual war, right? Fast forward, company folds, email address gone. Fine, I just need to change it. Easy peasy, right? WRONG.As soon as I tried to change my email, my account got flagged as “suspicious.” What? Did I accidentally donate too many troops to my clan? Did my barbarians start acting shady? No idea.So, I contacted customer support. I told them, ""Hey, I still have access to my old email, and you can send stuff there."" They came back with: ""It seems like there’s more than one user on your account.""More than one user?! I play on my iPhone, but I prefer the iPad for the bigger screen. Plus, I sometimes sign into Google Play because…well, that’s what a mobile game is supposed to let you do, right? Apparently, NOPE.They then asked me to list all the hardware I use to play the game. So, I sent them a detailed list of devices, including serial numbers, make, model, color (okay, maybe not the color). Still NOPE.Then, I thought, ""Alright, I'll go above and beyond."" I sent them a list of every single purchase I’ve made in the game—card details, bank statement, the works. Surely this is enough to prove I’m the rightful king of my own village, right? WRONG AGAIN.I’ve played every day for years, been a dedicated clan member, bought every gold pass for the last four years (you’re welcome, Supercell), and spent more money than I care to admit on skins. And yet, still NOPE.At this point, I’m convinced Supercell is just messing with me. Seriously, how much proof do I need to show to get my email changed? Supercell, you’ve earned the crown for most frustrating customer support in history. 👑"

Michael Clark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Ah the company that treats it's customers like dirt with zero respect. A close friend of mine has been playing this game since 2016 and last week had his account suspended due to 'suspicious activity'. They won't give any details as to what this is but have told him the account will be permanently deleted. He has done NOTHING wrong! Don't worry I told him this is a $2b company; they'll have an appeals process. How stupid am I - the only feedback he's got so far is that they're working on a complaints process but don't have one yet. No response from the CEO mailbox either. So to all you payers out there - a word of caution - this bunch of clowns are judge, jury and executioner with no interest in the facts. Play at your peril"
Midhat Syed,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Bought brawl passes to gift from my son’s account to his brothers and cousins. Nowhere did it say that children can’t send or receive brawl passes as gifts.

Morrison,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Dreadful customer support. Contacted them on their ‘parents’ email. Received an almost immediate response saying they were too busy to look at my problem.
Linus Klee,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell’s games are fun at first, but they quickly start pushing in-game purchases to make real progress. While not all their games are outright pay-to-win, spending money definitely gives a big advantage, especially in competitive games like Clash of Clans and Brawl Stars. Plus, it’s worth noting that they’re majority-owned by Tencent, which makes you wonder how much of the focus is on profits over fair gameplay. It feels like they exploit younger players who get sucked into spending without even realizing it."
Kendyl,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Literally has the worst clash of clans support out to date. I provide everything there is to provide in order to get my account recovered and yet it’s not enough. F*** Supercell and everything they stand for. Go to hell !

Adel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"At first, let me to introduce my self. I’m a high rank player who own multiple accounts, also I’m leader of level 29 clan. This game is getting worse and worse in the time because they don’t have required structure to handle 500 million players. They are adding new rules that make you vulnerable, every second. Don’t wonder if they block you and simply ignore you even though you didn’t do anything wrong.They care only about money and you are nothing to them except of money factory, even as you see they don’t respond you here.Left this game as soon as possible if you have respect to your personality, time and hard earn money.

Zavier Monas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am a new player to clash of clans. I bought the gold pass because I figured the extra resources would help and $7 isn't that big of a deal. I did the challenges and daily tasks to progress along and made it all the way to the end of the pass. Keep in mind me being a new player, I don't know the limit of ""magic items"" by heart. I claimed my paid book of hero's and then tried to claim my free book of hero's because you get both at the end of the pass. I autonomously clicked claim on the first one and then I did the same on the second yet I made a mistake. I didn't realize it converts it into gems after you claim one. I just clicked ""claim anyways"" without thinking because again. In my mind it was just the claim button and I didn't know that pop up was a thing so i fast tapped. It gave me the 50 gems (which I didn't spend). Contacted support literally right after it happened. To spare an even longer version. They told me to ""just buy another one in the shop offers!"" like i was supposed to be excited to support them and give them more money. Then when I said I worked hard for it, instead of realizing ""wow this person did put time and effort into our game let's fix this"" they instead tell me to ""think about how it financially affects them""...why would I care how you giving me back a free item i EARNED affects your BILLION dollar company? What kind of horrible insult is that. Also I told them to take the gems back. I wasn't asking to keep the gems and get the book. I just wanted my free item i played and worked for back and they can pull gems from accounts. I know they can. They just didn't want too. They wanted me to really want that book badly enough that ""hey maybe we can milk another $14.99 out of him and make him buy another book through another shop offer"". No. I refunded through my bank to get my money back from the gold pass. I deleted my clash of clans account and will never play that game again and will never support supercell again. Enjoy your dying games because your inability to help your player bases and only care about money. Greedy company. "
Mepze,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I had two different agents completely dismiss the fact that one of the users in my clan bullied other members and asked for personal information, harrased one of my female clan mates forcing them into a relationship they didn't want to be in. they left death threats to others and their own life before leaving and even after offering screenshots of this behavior they completely dismissed me without giving any reasoning or even asking who the user was or for their user id very unprofessional! took over an hour to get the initial response and even after that they switched agents out of no where, though this one was faster to reply they gave no advice or show of concern for the serious topic at hand."

No way I'll be making any purchases because you will never get it even looked at if there's an issue let alone resolved. Customer service is beyond pathetic, it's simply non existent. The company is just on autopilot making money off its players that helped build it with no-one actually working there. "
mark Brown,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Usually, Supercell has the worst support in the world, creating more problems than they solve, and I’ve seen riddles that were less cryptic then some of there responses. It often feels like they’re just copying and pasting responses, rushing to end chats without really caring about the user. But recently, I had the best support experience. Dzemil P was an amazing and kind support agent who actually helped me recover my account, even though I didn’t explain my issue very well. I talked to three other agents before him, answered all their questions accurately, and they couldn’t do anything—one even made things worse by tying my account to a random spare email I had. Dzemil, on the other hand, not only got my account back but ensured it was tied to my main, secure email. This makes me much more confident about making purchases on my clash of clans account in the future. I was convinced I was talking to AI the whole time with other agents, but Dzemil was seriously great—funny, kind, and he knew exactly what he was doing. He 100% deserves a raise because, out of all the support agents I had he was the best by far."

My email account got hacked and they changed all my personal data including my phone number. I have since the 27th of June trying very hard to get it back, sent proofs of payments since 2020, the phones I used to play and they ignore all my attempts, either in the in game support and email. by email they close every attempt I make of contact or ignore me and the in-game support they either put me talking with bots or close my attempts of communication with a real person. This has been a horrible experience that I never thought I would find myself in to think I play this game almost every day for 4 years, paid them several times for different things and they IGNORE every attempt to recover my account that any person could very easily confirm its mine. Insane how a company with this size and community absolutely trashes it's fans and paying customers. "

I managed to get ALL my accounts back  except for supercell. They ask me for code that other person has now and that other person changed my codes without me even getting them on my email. And this trash company says its impossible to change the code once its set by someone. So some russian kid managed to change and hack my code but a company cant control their own game ? They always close the chat in middle of me typing. They say hello and then i am explaining my issue and they just close the chat and transfer me to a bot....

Their excuse for “not pay2win” is that “you can unlock everything free” except that would realistically take years of playing for hours every day to gamble of opening lootboxes for a chance to maybe get what you need.On top of all that they charge absurd amounts of money on worthless digital garbage, some low effort trash skins even costing up to 20$ in a mobile game!!!How is this company allowed to exist?"

Jaze,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I lost my account almost 2 weeks ago starting from 1/11/2024 Thursday morning.I simply went to the Supercell help support if they can be able to recover my account. There’s one staff named Santiago, who locked out my second account when he would’ve helped me to recover my main account. I can’t believe I have to change the Supercell ID email linked to my second account thanks to him.Days later, I was so confused not knowing how to contact support for another account since it’s just O.T.T.O. Bot until I found out I had to waste $6.99 plus tax to unlock lifetime live chat to talk to a real person.However, I’m not surprised that they have to keep redirecting me to O.T.T.O. Bot for a recovery code, I asked them if I don’t have one and now they decided to say when someone is on my account, the account is no longer mine. Again, I’m still confused by this statement because I have no idea what they meant.As for now, I have to move on and have to play on my second account which was TH13 dealing with it.Overall, I wish Supercell never added the feature called Supercell ID, that’s where scammers nowadays on social media can ask for your personal information to hop on your account and kick you out of the account you’ve been playing for over many years. If this system continues like this, most likely many players will quit this game for being an unprofessional and dissatisfactory response ever! Please make it simple if they want to get their players back to this game to continue playing. Otherwise, this will not convince players to come back to this game after not helping players who lost their account will most likely quit the game.Do your jobs properly! It's like you never get paid enough to do simple things, stop redirecting players who have no recovery codes and do something about it.I almost quit this game because of the lack of professionalism. What is this? ROBLOX support also couldn't help anyone to get their compromised account back and other game help supports couldn't do anything at all.My feelings about getting locked out nowadays made me feel frustrated, crazy, and uncomfortable playing the game."
François Lambert,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It's a scam company. For instance, if you read the 'Hayday' reviews in the Apple Store, you'll find many negative reviews. People report various issues, such as the inability to log in or never receiving a verification code. Furthermore, customer support never responds. Yet, despite these issues, such comments often have 5-star ratings, suggesting that either Supercell has manipulated the system or has some fraudulent arrangement with Apple. Their customer support never replies, yet they send emails asking, 'How happy were you with our service?"". Avoid it, and don't let them scam your kids with their ""games""."

gsquance,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"As a long-time enthusiast of competitive gaming, I've been both a witness to and participant in the worlds of 'Clash of Clans' and 'Clash Royale' created by Supercell. The games themselves are undeniably well-crafted, showcasing the developers' deep understanding of engaging gameplay and community-building.However, I have growing concerns regarding the monetisation strategies employed by Supercell. The practice of introducing new, overpowered characters, placing them behind a paywall, and subsequently 'nerfing' them once certain revenue targets are met is troubling. This approach not only undermines the integrity of competitive play but also takes advantage of the player's passion and investment in the game.In other industries, such as automotive, the equivalent practice would be inconceivable – selling a product only to diminish its capabilities after purchase. It is a tactic that raises serious ethical questions.Supercell has shown it knows how to create engaging games, but it is disheartening to see the business side overshadow the spirit of fair play with models reminiscent of gambling, exploiting the vulnerabilities related to addiction.I urge Supercell to revisit their policies and align their business practices with the ethics of fair play and respect for their community. It's time to recalibrate and remember that the longevity of a game is rooted in the trust and respect of its players."

Paul Richardson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"One of my Clash accounts got hacked, I reported this to them and they allowed me to retrieve the account and play it for a few months, and spend further money on it.  They then subsequently banned the account stating I breached the t&c’s, i.e., they suspect that I knowingly shared the account or sold it, despite me keeping the other 4 accounts. I raised a ticket with them advising them I had credible evidence of the hack in the form of screenshots and they promised to review it, I sent them the evidence with proof of my spending on that account, plus 4 other accounts I use that were not compromised and they did not respond at all. They closed my ticket and when I queried it they simply sent me the same generic template response, same as my initial query. They are not transparent about this, but they appear to have a zero tolerance policy on hacked accounts and have no intention of allowing the hacked account to be used long term, regardless of what evidence you provide them. But despite this, they appear to be happy to allow you to spend money on the account whilst they conduct their so called their thorough investigations. Their communication around the matter has been non existent and there doesn’t appear to be any way to make a complaint either, I have requested their complaints policy without receiving a response at all, and,  I requested my data in a GDPR request and they have also ignored that request - both are a breach of trading standards in the UK.

I went to help & support & asked why I’m not receiving the codes & they told me they suspect suspicious activity & wanted to ask me a few questions. The questions were, what was the first name of the account & the very first device used to play this account. Mind you the account was created over 10 years ago so I may have got the device wrong. No second chance or any other questions, they didn’t even consider I had the email & password to the account. It just got blocked straight away & the chat was ended. No explanation or instructions on what to do next to recover the account. It’s just gone, along with all the money I invested into that account which was almost maxed out townhall 15! The most ridiculous procedures & questions! One wrong answer, even by accident, can cost you your entire account. Never use help & support & if you do, when they ask if they can ask you a few questions, just end chat. Save yourself & your account!"

Bob Ritchey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have two accounts, both with almost identical names. After a few months away from the game due to travel, one of the accounts was inaccessible. I contacted support from my main account, answered their questions, and uploaded 3 years of game pass receipts for the account in question.  An agent, screen named shorty, accused me of trying to steal my second account and banned my first account for 31 days, as a warning.  They then disconnected from the chat without any opportunity for me to address whatever led them to their assumption.  Attempts to contact support by email, since both of my accounts are inaccessible, result in them telling me that I can only get support inside the game, which no longer works.  To sum up, they suck due to the arbitrary, cavalier way they ban people and there is no way to resolve the issue. Now I will call Helsinki HQ for one last try before abandoning a game in which I've invested thousands of hours.Update: the phone numbers I found on the web for their SF & Helsinki offices do not work. I got an email telling me that all bans are final and non-negotiable.  Anyone think that a class action approach may be appropriate to force a change in their support practices?"
HThaudal,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Just stay away.  Games great (but addictive) Customer service - used to be great.   Now (as many others claim).  If you try to recover one of your old accounts; but you don't use correct English, or provide exactly what they want to hear - they don't reply with a ""Unfortunately that is insufficient information.."".. but a no warning 31-day ban.Happy to take your money, but when you want your value back - they happily issue bans left/right/centre.It's not for the gamer (anymore), it is for profit.  Expect their ""agents"" are nothing but AI automated bots - unable to think, but happy to issue bans when there's a violation between inquiry and algorithm.Advice:  Games are great - but stay away, it will just lead to endless frustration.  And if you want to be top, you have to spend.Roll-back to the great customer service, and player experience.Journey was great while it lasted - but .. you have taken steps away from your players."

van der Klugt,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There is no help desk. Just a robot. You lose boosters and nobody help you grrrr
Dean Cragg,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"After the recent update it’s clear all they care about is squeezing the last bit of profit they can from clash of clans. They’ve now destroyed the game on purpose and made it much harder for everyone to progress on the builders base and literally destroyed most of the progress the mid level players have made on the builders base so that they can force people to buy gems knowing that everyone has spent too much time on the game to quit now. It’s no coincidence that they released the most expensive bundles I’ve ever seen on the same day and dramatically cut your loot earnings. I’m glad to see that it’s impossible to find a match on the builders base too, hopefully everyone stops playing because I’m done. The game will be dead within a year because once a company makes a mistake of this magnitude nowadays they just double down and can’t admit it. Y’all should be ashamed of yourselves and I hope people vote with their wallets and run y’all out of business. Buying out YouTubers to manipulate 12 year olds to use mommy’s credit card on gems only works for so long"
Walter Buchko,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The new builder base is designed as a money grab and PURPOSELY has been shrunk in size in order to destroy MULTI-MILLIONS worth of gems & dollars spent in base designs using the pre-updated shovels. This would NOT be an issue if Supercell kept the main base the same size!! And they add stupidly ridiculous expensive in app purchases to boot! There is no possible way they could not have done this deliberately! This company once again has clearly displayed a festering, putrid disease of ultimate greed and corruption. What do they do in their free time? Kick puppies and set fire to pandas? I have NO RESPECT for this evil company!"
Noah,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Your game makes want to commit suicide! It’s a cheating piece of bull! I will literally kill myself if you don’t fix it.

I am serious about killing myself because of your game.
Simon Fraser,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Like others I tried to recover an old account. I was asked a few questions and was then banned for 31 days. It appears as I used my brothers account, who incidentally is in the same family clan, to access their customer services, they decided I was trying to get an account that’s not mine. What a totally idiotic quantum leap.I tried to reason with them over the course of a dozen emails and explain exactly why and what happened, but it seems there is no going back once a ban has been imposed. Eventually, they decided there was no point in continuing the email exchange and they’d close the case. I really would sue them if it was feasible. I have nothing but contempt for the way they have treated me. What a lousy way to treat your customers. Hang your head in shame!"
Antonio Ferreira,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I tried to get my village back, I didn't get any feedback and suddenly I'm banned. How is this even called support? I assume Supercell just wants to see tickets closed, so anything that is not resolved by the automatic bot, gets banned and that's it, you can't complain anymore. Sad to say the least..."
Cape qk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Tried to recover my old account and got banned.. I’ve worked with my town for years and spent some money in-game, and now it’s banned for NO reason. Support is also awful and will just replay with a standard answer."

Utterly rubbish service centre.

Jan Paulusma,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,That %$#$%^@^$^$% guy of the costumer support from clash royal gave me a ban for 31 days because i want to get back my clash royal account due to a vertification code tru email.. The problem is my email account is locked.. he asked me information about that Clash Royal account i try to get back.. And i know for sure 99% of the inforamtion i gave him is accurate! Now he is stating i try to break into somebody else his account! and if i tell him i can proof my outlook account which is connected to my clash royal i account is locked then it's silent from their site!!! So now they banned me for 31 days on my new account also!! i know clash royale is reading this bcoz i selected that option in this review on trust pilot! So i DARE Clash Royale customer support to react on my review! they probably are not going to react on my review because then they have to admit at the end that they made a mistake! They expect you to remember which day month and year you create this clash royale account! i got like 50 games on my phone you really think i am going to remember stuff like that?! also they asked me which devices i played clash royale on and i may not remember them all but i gave them at least 5 different devices which i played clash royale on! Then also i got the question which kings level i am! i told them i am max kingtower level which is king tower level 14 and it took me years to get there! Then they asked me if i did any purchases in the store! Which i did with googple prepaid years ago i purchaed GEMS like 3 or 4 times in a couple of hours! Also i told them my gamertag name and i told them at least 2 clans i have been participating in which are Jonah Beast & Dutch Warriors! Now tell me how can i know all this if this was not my account?! also i can proof the email adress attached/connected to the clash royale account is locked and that is the exact reason why i can not proceed the verification code process because in order to do that i need acces to my email account which is locked which i can proof either! So again i DARE Clash Royale to react on my review here on Trust Pilot! Because i know i am right! i know its my account! i know it took me years to get maxed out king tower level! and i dont want to start all over again!!! i want my old account back!
Rita Kiraly,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Appaling customer (player) support. It's a real shame because the games are quite good but the lack of meaningful and genuine support is easily off-putting. They provide chat support but most of the time don't actually help or even bother to read the query just throw it back saying ""they only provide limited support for your game"" (wth does that even mean when it's their game and I chose a topic from their list??!) and the advisers intentionally terminate the case so you can't follow it up or ask more questions. I tried to leave some feedback and feature suggestions, they claim there should be an option but ISN'T. Just giving me the runaround multiple times. Could have just said they don't care about feedback. Or you as a player in general. Very disappointing experience."

Ryan Quinlan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've played supercell back in 2017 spent a lot of money on it and recently tried to get back into it by recovering my account obviously I've had several emails since then and it wasn't sure which one it was tied to however I knew the player name on account. I gave the guy my three emails and then he sends me a link of my purchase history but it was only tied to my most recent email and so I said hey I can't seem to find the information you're looking for whoever on my Google Play I was able to see the dates of the purchases and the amounts but he wanted a special code they didn't provide. This obviously wasn't enough information but when I signed into my old Google account I was able to find the code he was looking for and when I contacted them again to give them this information they told me the account was not mine and banned me for a month. that basically stealing it is mine and I had all the necessary proof. Supercell just wants to take your money and run
Jakob Munch Overgaard,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This experience was by far the worst customer support ticket handling my life. Yes, you heard that right.Normally I do not make that many negative reviews, but I most say I was extremely dissatisfied as a customer after this disaster.The outcome was --tragically-- no resolution, but a banned secondary account (for phishing) by mistake made by support after faulty directions, which I was highly skeptical about.Negatives:- Auto-generated replies with all the same tedious stuff over and over again.- Support does not read the replies thorough.- Support does not honor technical knowledge by the customer.- Support had very poor technical skills.- I was not able to escalate the ticket to a 2.-level technician or speak to a supervisor.- The problem still persists, but ticket is closed.- During the error correction, support suddenly asked me to send the error details thru in-game support, which is basically just a browser window.- During the ticket handling in-game support mistakenly banned me for phishing, although I referred to the ticket-ID. Tragicomic.- No compensation for the disaster support experience.Positives:- Fast replies.- I got my secondary account back."
Sh fahad Fahad,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,How can anyone hack my account so easily. Without supercell it was very protective but supercell protection was very poor. ID I have been playing for 7 years is just gone because of supercell couldn't protect it. Damn you supercell.
Patryk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I asked for my clash royale account recovery, I gave my email and all account details (also the devices I played on, because they asked) but they banned my account anyway, because they think I'm impersonating and trying to take over the account XD I presented the whole situation to them. I have also emailed them several times since 2021 and no response via in-game chat however they have helped me. Worst support, I lost my 5 year old account :)"

Cameron Dobransky,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I will never play another Supercell game.  After years of not playing Clash of Clans, I decided to re-download it as a bunch of my friends we're starting to get back into playing.  My original account that I had that I spent a great deal of time, money, and effort on was unfortunately linked to my old email account that I shutdown and deleted.  The ""Help and Support"" page was the biggest waste of time, the directions were poor and unclear for what I was trying to achieve. When I finally found the way to go about recovering my old account, I was subsequently banned from playing the game for 31 days because they thought I was trying to steal my old account.All I wanted was to be able to play the game with my friends again and pick up where I left off.  I have deleted all Supercell games from my phone and will never re-download after this experience."
Bas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have multiple accounts in the game. One account got hacked. So I was trying to get the account back with my other accounts.

CountD,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could post 0 stars I would.  There is so much cheating that goes on in their games and they do NOTHING about it.

Mido S.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst support ever. I had Clash of Clans account and i have had for many years. Spent alot of time and money on it. Lost my phone and just a got a new one. Logged in and everything was fine. Was online a couple of days then i choose to ask SC support for help. I just asked them to log out from all devices then i could log in my self. Because i have my own email that i have had for 20 years and my own SC ID so i can just log in my self and could have peace. 2 min later the account was locked and now i cant acces it???? I tried writting to the support but they accused me of trying to sell my account? Doesnt make sense because i want to sell it i would just sell the email. Ans i never asked to get moved to another email. I should never have asked their support for help...

Tegyaru,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I played bs since the BETA until March 2022. Things started going downhill after releasing Belle. Belle isn't a bad brawler but after that they seem to be releasing a brawler once a month and overpricing them on the first day it's released so people can buy them. I believe that Supercell is ptw. Releasing too many brawlers is so overwhelming for a new person playing the game along with reducing the value of existing characters which makes the game so boring now.Safety: There are lots of weirdos who claim to be a teen and send nasty messages be careful if your a girl.Edit: Things are much better now than they were before. Supercell actually solved their issues

Андрија Фердинанд,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I've been playing the game for 9 years and I received bot replies. This was the 2nd time I contacted them, with the last time being several years ago.My defending layout is set to a non-existing old layout I deleted over a year ago. It does not exist in my war nor active layouts, it is th13 and not th14, and people who attack me wipe me clean in legend league because I can't change it.I sent screenshots to this band of outsourced bots, and they replied to my questions with templates and general how to tips. I even sent a bug report, and received no feedback. People are still attacking me and eating my trophies. None of my questions were answered.For the cherry on top of the cake, they closed the ticket and said they cannot help. Cannot help me change a layout that DOESN'T EXIST in my account, and is MISSING A CHAMP. I tried changing it, it didn't work. What's the bloody point of competing then? What's the point of contacting them? Who will reimburse me for this technical glitch and lost time? I expect reimbursement and an email from Supercell and I'm ticking this notify box. I will submit another honest review if I do not hear from them within 3 business days.Stop outsourcing Customer Support from third world countries without making them take an English & product knowledge test. This experience was outraging and useless, and made me waste my time.Not spending another dollar until I hear back."
WS,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I would give zero stars here if I could. Their help and support function is a joke. They lock your account and then ask for your player ID. How can you access it if the game is locked? Then they have this autobot that automatically answers named OTTO which doesn't help at all and then when you finally do get one of their Human counterparts they ask for your first purchase receipt, which isn’t easy to find but I provided and then they want the history of every device I have played on for the last 10 years. Even guessing and back tracking pretty accurately they still give you an autoanswer saying Thank you but for security purposes your account must remain locked for my own protection... Seriously protected from my own account?!!! What about an email Authenticator like every other legitimate company out there?

I have spent a 5 digit figure over the past 8 years with supercell on their boombeach App. They cannot give me the time of day when my accounts were hacked and stolen.

DYBEFAPi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They make good games but their support service is really pathetic.I wanted to change the email address linked to my Supercell ID.  No option to do it natively, contact with their support is mandatory.First, the change of email address is not mentioned anywhere, then you choose the option ""Contact us"" to finally be put in touch with a damn robot with pre-selected answers and guess what, no option to change your email address. I had to answer bullsh!t until the robot deigns to put me in touch with a human and attention, answer after three days!Their games are really good but as said, their Supercell ID system is really poor and this support is absolutely despicable.

And after ive spend over 100$ on there game on pass royals they cant even do a 1 time refund.

Jesse James Chisholm,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They are a toxic company driven by extracting the most amount of money from your wallet as they can with micro transactions and subversive tactics. If I could rate this any lower I would. I have played several of their games and it always boils down to who paid the most money to get the mcguffin that makes you win. Brawlstars is one of the worst offenders with how the game is designed, It is a half baked game that steals from better games of it's kind. Even putting aside the blatant game mode plagiarism, they keep adding stronger characters to the people that pay for them while the free to play characters don't even get balance updates, keeping the people who don't pay to play in the weakest position they could be in. This obviously encourages them to pay. Now, I understand they do not have ads and paying for power is optional but when it is the ONLY recourse for winning that is a massive issue. This company needs to be brought to its knees for the parasitic practices they okay day after day."
Joshua Thomas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They scam people out their money, and if you play their games, they purposely match lower level players against a lot higher level players. They do this to try and force people to pay to rank up. Supercell games are not worth your time or money."
Ben Rich,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They have locked and banned over ten of my clash of clans and clash royale accounts now. I don’t know why I even play their games anymore. And when I try to unlock their stupid and unexplainable locks on my accounts, I give them absolutely everything they ask for wasting hours of time putting every little memory I can think of into my responses. Then what do they say? “It appears you’re trying to claim an account that isn’t yours” or something along those lines. THEN?! Boom, banned. Never getting the hundreds of dollars and hours of progress I wasted on these games. Don’t put anything that you can’t get back into here. If there was a zero star that’s where you’d see this review."
Zaroff,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"CA$H Royale. Arguably the worst ""game"" in history, by what is arguably the most despicable, detestable and vile game company in history. Yes, yes, even worse than EA ;) What a giant scam that is. It's rather dismaying reading all the comments about people crying over their lost money... It's a commonly known and accepted fact that $upercell are crooks. Nothing new under the sun. The reputation as consummate scammers they've earned over the years isn't usurped. They're just common right thieves that succeeded, NOTHING more. Every game they put out is rigged to the core, and you can't make any sort of substantial progress unless you let go of hundreds of bucks. Play twice any one of their games and it's immediately apparent. You just have to be discerning enough to never give them a cent. Play for free, don't fill up their coffers. Simple... Personally I uninstalled all their games rather quickly, as playing for free ultimately is pointless with $upercell. Of course they don't give half a rat's butt what people think or write on sites like these as they're laughing their way to the bank every day, so the point is moot. Let's not even mention the ""cu$tomer support"" creeps... TL;DR: avoid $upercell traps and scams at all costs (no pun intended). $upercell is to gaming what pornography is to cinema, or justin bieber to music. Same sort of contribution. Vulgar, overdone, and downright shady. The ""matchmaking"" has got to be THE most rigged, disloyal and crooked system ever devised in a computer game. Rotten to the core wouldn't begin to describe it. Either that stuff was coded by drunk monkeys, or more likely, $upercell are indeed the crooks they're well known to be. The vastest scam in gaming history.P.S.: $upercell, you ARE thieves. You rig your games. You steal from people. If I'm wrong, all this is libel, punishable by law, and I belong in jail. If I'm not, YOU belong in jail. I DARE you to sue me. I DARE you. Do sue me, and have a court subpoena your source code. Then we'll laugh.I repeat: You are *criminals*. And you should see the light of a court one day. Just a matter of time."
AMH- IQ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They locked  my account  without reason  and when i contact them they asked  me terrible questions that no one could remember  it at all specially  for some one have being playing  for 8-9 years
Mark Garrod,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely appalling.  Double payment confirmation function missing from a specific skin offer…accidental purchase…they did nothing.  Worse they initially claimed they have double confirmation and that this was a safeguard.   Ignored my emails and in app contact.  I had video evidence.  Soon as I shared this, they completely ignored it and all my efforts to contact them.  Disgusting."
Niccolò,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They banned my account after I asked if it was possible to change the email of my supercell account. I spent more than 50 euros on the game. What kind of support bans his players for asking a question?

Monkey Bender,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"What the **** do you mean by happy with your service? You did shi* and ask for rating. What a dumb thing to do. One of the worst customer service ever. No chat service. You claim there is one but its just a pre record one. No different than a F&Q. What's the bloody point.I wasted my life playing this game and now I can't even get my saved game because it wouldn't send verify code to my Gmail. I looked everywhere spam to primary. Even search for clash of clan, clash royale, and supercell. Didn't pop a thing up. DONT PLAY THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY GAME. they have no customer service. And will fuc* you over when you need customer service."
Filip,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Yes they ban accounts without any explanation but it's still a very good company who make very good games.
Louis Ainscow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Banned my account for trying to recover an old game account through the suport portal. Very disappointing!
Antoine,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tried to recover my old account from 5 years ago. Now i got banned for 31 days. Very nice…
Tombsa,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have reported and contacted many times customer support of finnish clash royale and telling about abuse of mentally unstable person who comes saying rude and offensive things. I'm clan leader with high clan trophies so I cannot change it to ""invite only"" because we are recruiting new players all the time. It has been going long time now and it happens many times per day and still customer support is not helping at all. You can read from Supercell website how they are against bullying very much but it appears not to be so."
Bill,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell is total dogsh*t. They have horrible matchmaking. I have literally won 3 out of my last 20 games. I suspect they do this on purpose expecting that I will purchase something from their dogsh*t selection of packages. I have made purchases in the past but to no avail, they simply match me against higher level opponents until I get crushed again and so the cycle continues. This company is a total scam. You will get no joy from playing their games. Save yourself the time and money and find another game developer."
Dan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely disgusting company. Across all games I play hosted by supercell I have had issue after issue with the “support” team, they never pay attention to the messages and just close cases.  This gets worse as of yesterday, they banned an account for asking for help to retrieve another account (which I proved ownership of) , and then blatantly refuse to communicate with me regarding it, it becomes extremely infuriating to have something taken away but more so to be accused of being a criminal and treated like one as a result.  I would suggest if you don’t already play these games. DONT, the games are good the morals of the company running them are pathetic to say the least!"
Oliver Yeoman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,this company has the worst customer support I’ve ever experienced! I contacted them to retrieve my old account which I hadn’t logged into for years but couldn’t provide all the information they were asking for. I have since got all the information but now have been banned for 31 days and ghosted whenever I try to get in touch.
Corn Flakes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I gave 1 star bcause there is no zero.I contacted them more than 10 times..... That worst bot comes and gives us a reply to wait patiently....

Martin Bejaj,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"They banned me for contacting them to get my old account back. I just contacted them, not stole anything or did anything illegal. They just banned me without investigating. They could at least have told me that the account i was trying to get back simply isn‘t mine and that would be okay. But no, they banned me for 31 days without further notice. One of the worst customer service i have experienced, for not THE WORST."
Phillip Scott,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"After 3 yrs Of not playing COC I decided to play again. I couldn't get connected to my old game so I asked supercell for help. They asked for 3 or 4 documents including a screenshot of 1st gem purchase. I couldn't remember how to find gem purchase & I made an error in the game ID #, but  I knew enough that only the owner would know and with the slightest amount of patience & help could have corrected my errors. But NO, they called me a thief, said I was unsportsmanlike ban me for 30 days and said if I contact them again I would be permanently ban. I am upset with myself I didn't take a screenshot, I was shocked & embarrassed. I eventually found my list of gem purchase, it was $965 over 6 years."

Miles Grover,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I wanted to speak with customer service about how Clash Royale was becoming unfair with people having prince in arena 1 2 and 3 but the automated machine wouldn’t let me talk to an assistant. It is the s**ttiest machine ever and when someone finally came. They told me my response wasn’t good enough to discuss with. What the h**l supercell. I spent at least 500 bucks on there games and when I say that clash Royale isn’t very fun Anymore because I always lose to people having prince you tell me it isn’t good enough?!! Well you are something. They also for god knows what reason they don’t talk to people over the phone. They only do massages which is also bulls**t. And people wander why supercells games die off quickly. I would recommend you don’t spend any money to they s**t hole supercell has become.
Janech Thanner,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercells' support staff is hands down, the sh**iest, the worst, the most horrible experience ever. I tried to get my old village back in COC, and they would not listen. They just banned the account i was writing from, for 31 days, for claiming that i illegally, tried to get hands on something, that didn't belong to me... Which is bullsh*t... 3 years lost gameplay right there"
Milton Lam,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"bro, ladder is so unbalanced, i keep getting match ups with over level levels. the process is just so slow being a free to play. everyone has the pass and over levelled cards and king tower.

SGEGGbub,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely horrible support from Supercell. About a year ago they banned COC account for no reason, I contacted support and they just said ""disruptive behaviour"" even thought I hadn't played in months nor was in a clan. I asked why and they ghosted me. Same thing happened a year later, absolutely horrible company and it's a shame they own great games. I wish they sell them off to a better parent."

This support is fk!ng stupid. Complete waste of money and time."
Paul Ellison,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"My account got blocked for security reasons. Since I created it a year ago I still had all the information, which I supplied. Even after this, they said there’s nothing they can do. I guess it was hacked and they gave the account to the hacker. I’ve never ever dealt with such incompetent, arrogant, and unprofessional amateurs like these people from “customer services”. My advice, stay away from all games Supercell."
customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Purchased Farm Pass more than 36 hours ago. Did not receive in-app purchase. 14 days were left on FP. Contacted support. Still haven't heard from them. Now we are down to 13 days and counting! I've been cheated out of game play that I bought because they have yet to respond!
Modified_shark,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This game use to be fun and entertaining but after they have added these broken characters that are not balanced at all it has made this game unplayable. How did you do this to this game. Stop introducing new cards and fix the ones in the game. The mega knight should not be as strong as it is but if you wanna make it that strong make it cost more elixir. It’s not that hard. Use your brains for once
Joseph Saavedra Monkey,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Clash royale is a great game but the elixir is way to slow in a regular game.Also after three loss you can't play any more sucks but what sucks more is it cost 50 gems or the battle pass to play again.
Joshua,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"After being dedicated to Clash of Clans for 9 years, my account was hacked and my clan was stolen. I believed that Supercell could assist me, so I contacted their support team. I was forced to use my alternate account, which was less valuable but that I still spent years building up. I was initially stuck in a loop with a chatbot that had no ability to direct me to a real person, so I had to tell them that I had a different issue. After finally getting in contact with a person, I explained my problem. The support agent, a grown adult with a job, began roleplaying as if they were a ""village chief"" who had been through a similar experience, but that they kept their chin up and restarted from scratch. Then they offered me a glimpse of real assistance by asking me for my account's ID, recently used devices, and purchase history. After giving them the requested information and 5 transaction IDs proving me as the owner of my account... they banned me. They banned me for ""account phishing attempts"" despite overwhelming proof that I was the owner, and warned me that ""further unsportsmanlike actions"" would result in a permanent ban."
Quin Sational,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Tried to recover my account. Code never gets sent to my email. customer service asks me questions I can't possibly remember. No one would remember. Years of progress down the drain because I forgot my password and they won't just email the recovery code to the attached email. If Supercell is reading this, Its not a tax return, its a freaking game."
William Batman,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,disgusting company. all i want is to recover my old account back. i get that phising is an issue but just deny the request if it seems suspicious. banning innocents is just ridiciculous. used to like the company not its just disgusting
Frank Tsai,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This company is sh*it, ban my account please and delete my profile in supercell id, I don't want to see any of this sh*it game anymore, even the company name is irritating to hear"
Fred Smith,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"The quality and knowledge of the support staff is about as low as you can get. They allow hackers to phish accounts off them, and then when the rightful owner tries to recover the account, they ask questions designed to fail in most cases (since too much time has passed and the owner won't remember exact details) so that they can temp or perma-ban the rightful account owner."
Stephen Crowe,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I gave one star due to the fact giving zero is not an option.The so called tech ""sparky"" is clueless about customer support. This know nothing twit gets butthurt when he/she/it receives a little constructive criticism to help her/him with retrieving an account. COME ON SUPER CELL! Hire someone who doesn't live in the damn basement of their parents!"
r m,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"You give their ‘customer support’ all the details they request and you simply get auto replies saying something does ‘not match.’Ask what so you can search for it and they say something does ‘not match their database’’…. Again ask what and they send another bot message ‘this item has already been resolved/answered, no more emails will be responded to and you may email about something else in the future.’As a parent trying to help their kid you would think they would offer assistance.  Supercell is now a money grab just mailing it in, take a kids money but offer no assistance with his getting back in.  Disgraceful company, pay them but realize they do not care.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY THEY ARE NOT ABOUT THE CONSUMER JUST THE PAYCHECKS.Still no action, they just do not care….SUPERCELL IS A POS COMPANY WITH ZERO REGARD FOR LOYAL PAYING PLAYERS, wish there was a review like this prior to our getting into it, would have saved the money an frustration.   Be proud of what you have become Supercell…. no wonder your revenue stream keeps taking hits and continually drops…"
Drew,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Yeah the whole “we can’t do nothing if a clan member kicks everyone in your clan” is bad thing to teach children. It’s because they know it happens all the time because the clan dynamics are set up weird. It’s not that you can’t but that you won’t. Like they could easily monitor this by making a limit on coleaders kicking members or make it against the rules but no I think supercell actually supports griefing which is kinda sad coming from a mobile game built for youth. What kind of thing are they trying to teach these kids. Be as mean as you want to be because there is no consequences for your actions.
Araysh Inferno,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I don't understand Supercell. The new update destroyed everything. Overall it's good but they seriously have to work on their programing so that you don't lose all of your data. It can be fun but at the same time annoying when it glitches.
Mist,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,So I get a 7 day ban for insulting a clan owner who disrepected me? Get lost I won't play your game ever again and will give you a nice 1 star rating with 10 other accounts on your play store app

Bryson Catmull,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give negative stars I would. Clash Royale SuperCell team changed my name, Shagger, which I have had since beta to their generic name with no reasoning or contact attempted on their end for an explanation why. After I finally reached them through Help and Support in game, they told me I had violated their terms of service with the name being deemed inappropriate and that I was welcome to spend gems for a name change. I have been in this game since beta, easily have spent at least a couple hundred dollars, and they just close the conversation on me after I demanded a further explanation when they couldn't even tell me why the name was inappropriate to them, even though I've been using this handle for 16 years. They ignored me outright and gave no further explanation. I am so angry and irritated, and even more so that they can't even give me a free name change. BrawlStars did me dirty as well, but at least they gave me a free name change. So to the pieces of sub human filth on the Clash Royale SuperCell team, you are all worthless trash with the worst customer service I have ever experienced, especially having been loyal to the brand for as long as I've been. You should all be ashamed of what you do and do the industry a favor and just drop off the face of the earth you worthless trash."
Robert Featherby,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Do not let your children play these games.  They foster and promote the worst sportsmanship ever.  Customers exchange real world money to have a chance of being competitive, yet SuperSELL has the right to change the dynamics of the game regularly in order to make you uncompetitive and have to reinvest to stay ""competitive"".  The matchmaking is completely rigged and ends up in very one sided matches that cannot be won by one side or the other.  That means that it is not a game, mearly a process which customers go through in order to enable SuperSELL to take more money from them.  Id happily pay to play the game if it was the least bit skill oriented and not rigged.  And they will never ever ever delete your profile even when you go through the ""proper channels""   I see serious potential here for a class action lawsuit.  They sell yoi a product and keep changing it... criminal"

Rod Woodward,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have been playing the game for years and now that i have something to ask for assistance on, the support is hideous!

Thomas Wuensch,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst game manager in the industry. Customer service is non existent. All they care about is how they can fleece their customers.
Max Power,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Pay to win, dopamine rapping scum is how I would describe Supercell.  There are so many negative reviews online. It's unreal.  If you're a parent, I highly recommend you keep your children away from this game. It's more addictive than some soft drugs.  Gives no value other than frustration.  Shame on you Supercell, shame on you."
Edison Ricord,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is the most greedy company I have ever come across. They're also the biggest liars when it comes to how their servers for the games run, total frauds.

PPMV,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I believe I have a bug where I cannot load into my village. I believe something happened during the recent server maintenance which is not Supercell's fault, bit everything afterwards has been horrendous.First, the layout of their in-game support. The support relies so heavily on the fact you can load into your village that there's nothing there to message them about. All of the subjects are about hacked accounts, which while this makes sense, I've done research to see I'm not the only one affected by this. So I cleared my data so I could load into a started village to message the people. Every single time I got in contact with somebody, the just wanted to transfer my Supercell ID email address which I attempted over and over to explain failed to work and was not the issue. But their mods Sara, Edwin, and the three other people I spoke to were useless in trying to fix the problem.Second, I had to send 3 different emails to them. The email on the store page for contact had a bit reply that essentially said they wouldn't respond and that wasn't the right address...okay, I thought to myself. A bit odd, but maybe it's changed. I then emailed the account where parents can report issues and got another bot message saying essentially the same thing. So I found one more address that I emailed and haven't heard from since. It's been weeks now and I have received no help whatsoever and I don't imagine I'll be compensated in any way once this is hopefully fixed in the next update as it seems to be a simple bug. If not, RIP my TH14 village..."
Ken Imes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SuperCell favors spammers over actual players of the game. Look elsewhere for a game developer. These people suck.

Justin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Horrible.  I provided everything needed to recover my Clash of Clans account.  I even went as far as providing them with the last four of my card that was used to make purchases for the game pass.  After trying to recover the account Several Times, they stopped responding to my emails.  This would not be such a big deal and this is my first ever negative written review, but I was a th13 going to 14 soon (I max everything out including walls before leveling up), so TIME and MONEY was put into the game.  To be treated like this is just incompetent and dumb, to say the least.  I wish I could rate this as a Zero star."

Cain Turton,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I lodged a recovery request with supercell as it had been a few years since I played clash of clans.

I never leave reviews so for me to do this should show just how terrible the experience was. Be careful.
Andefinus,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Every time where there is an Event in Clash Royal im always getting matched with enemies that have way too powerful cards that i cant even have at my level.

Greg Harburn,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No response no matter what happens to your account. All these game companies are bad but these are probably the worst. Computer geeks never did have much human skills.until I got a refund from Google with in minutes they responded by saying they will and did remove things from my account. So they this is what happens when you give to much power to geeks with no human skills. Account don't work they won't respond get a refund they respond. I cant lie I would love to meet any of these people.

Theo Foltz,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Notice how there is no customer feedback from the ""developers"" they are garbage. They don't deserve to have any game out there. You have the lazy ones who don't care about spending money and blow it all on games with them. They manipulated it to where you need to pay in order to win. For instance I never payed for clash royal. Not supporting a game unless I play it. Garbage absolute garbage they act like we can't tell when you're fighting a joy to let you win in the beginning . You will fight a real person get smashed 3 times in a row and then you'll get a match up for teams that don't even attack. They need to fix the pairing aspect of the game to match the players level, unless you want the worst support from a company you will ever experience and a game that doesn't allow you to go far at all without putting money into it, stay far away from this company. They won't write back because they are cowards and know people will pay anyway so they won't do anything to help us out. I truly hate this company from the bottom of my heart and I hope they go bankrupt and lose everything. Either fix your game or delet it, if you are looking at reviews wondering if u want the game or , you don't, don't waste ur time."
Dan Griffin,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Supercell is garbage. They pick and choose who to kick out of a closed clan game (clash of clans). If you swing one one they'll boot you. If you say the wrong thing they boot you. They do things that an actual company would be fined for. It crazy how san Francisco of all cities allows this type of business in their city. I hope everyone in the company gets diarrhea for life.

GG_Sniper,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nothing else needs to justify my argument besides the fact that whoever made the supercell games matchmaking has severe Down syndrome. (How do you expect me to beat a person with level 13 cards when mine are level 9? Or better yet attack/defend a town hall 11 when I’m town hall 9?)

Marvellous magician,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Their game are pretty ridiculous. They are aiming to the kids weakness by creating cute character and skins, but the game itself ain't for kids. They are basically for 16+ or older.The game design for brawl stars are frustrating for most players such as the unfairness of game matching systems, power difference, brawlers counters. The game environment are mostly toxic than enjoying in most cases. The game maps are not logical and its 2+ minutes match are worst. Because it is 2 minutes, players will keep on playing that 2 minutes even they know they will lose at the end. It is more waste of time and get annoyed than to enjoy and have fun.People are easily get depression and lost temper. For this, players think they are getting challenge,but the game has a system to troll them. The game has a matchmaking system that either provide the high trophies opponents with counter pick or a extreme smart AI bot. Also, a red wifi delayed is also introduce for higher chance to lose."

For example, COC if you contact their support for anything regarding a new or old account of your they WILL ban you for 'phishing' which is their way of saying f you youve spend hundreds and when you need help im going to leave you with nothing. Don't just take my word for it you can see thousands of people who have had this happen. Not only that they have the audacity to say they care about their players so much so that they don't reply after their initial response of 'your account is banned for phishing' they give you a pre written response then not reply at all.

simon Woods,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Claims they are a Finnish company but are owned by Tencent who are Chinese and are well known for rigging games and employ a support service that is substandard and aims only to frustrate casual gamers. They don’t help when contacted and close chats as they choose not to answer your problems. Th win rate in the game is less than 10% and the matchmaking system is to blame for this as it puts you against players that have a perfect counter and if played enough is 100% shown to be biased towards players of Chinese origin. This company is worse than a plague and shouldn’t be allowed to make games. They are happy to take your money and time but don’t ask for any help as they don’t care. Only 1% of players get any help from them and they give them players free currency and cards to stay at the top and create YouTube videos to promote their game. This is 100% rigged and really shouldn’t be played by anyone.

amp amp,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercells’ only objective is to get your money.They call it free to play games, however, they use free to players as a prey to paid member. Either you wait for eternity to have a decent game play or invest 1000s of Dollars. If you look at the life cycle of their games, it gets famous but people quickly realize their motive and leave. There are a lot of better other game developers who produce quality games without so much gimmicks.Don’t start with their games as either your bank balance will reduce or you are a prey to paid members."
Yuki G,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell did an amazing job making Clash Royale, excellent game! They are killing their own game, they nerf way, and I mean WAY more than they buff, it’s not balanced at all and you can never use a single deck forever with it being as effective as it once was.

Salim Sadman,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Supercell is one of the best companies. But truly one of the best companies isnt doing the right things in its games. Such as in clash of clans the copy layout update has made players to copy each other's base. Due to this everytime when i go to attack in multiplayer battles i see tons of players with the same base. Even in wars some clans use these copied bases. Most of these copied bases they copied is based on good defense, For this it is becoming very tough for me to attack in wars and in multiplayer battles and even my clan is also facing this trouble. This also disrupts the creativity of the players as they copy these bases. Even by copying they reach higher leagues by winning trophies. The same thing is also seen in builder base also. Players like me are also facing the same problem. So if supercell gets to see this,they should disable the copy layout option. If it is done gamers like me will have a peaceful gaming and they will get to enjoy its benefits. Secondly the copied bases of the players who copied the bases should be deleted if possible."
Trent Gallo,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Just the worst support staff I’ve ever encountered. The way it played out was instead of doing their work or job the kid felt it would be easier just to ban my profile for phishing rather than recover my old profile from 2014. These children suck and to the effect of the fact I would have put real money to work on my old profile. However even with evidence the profile was mine they distribute punishment like a dictatorship. In time I hope online service laws change so I can press charges for my time stolen and my intention defamation.Lazy and stupid. Thanks for a number of full offences on someone only looking to enjoy a product not trying to steal pixels . The evidence is documented on my personal files with supporting people who know it’s my profile
Olegas Ševčenko,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"BrawlStars.Best way to describe is gold diggers, they changed my name because it was innapropriate in another language so they decided to change to ”Fighter” and not give me instead of giving me a chance to choose another one (how for example League of Legends do), but no after it happened I contacted support and they were very rude to me and I felt offended for the whole week by the attitude they gave me, they told me i need to donate to change my name which is not my fault? If they not happy about my name then let me change dont tell me to pay. And they also refused to fix the issue that I got, after opening the chests for 1 month I didnt get any increase of chance on getting legendary, and they answered if I will send something again on this topic they will put ban me for some time and I will need to wait, all they care is money. By the way, I was at very high high trophies score and I was actually having good talent and had alot of tactics but now I regret all my years I spent on it, they dissapoint me and change my mind of becoming a pro at this game. Hate this company will never forgive them for that. Also if you see this review for second time then just so you know its because I copy paste on every review platform i see because they deserve this."

Karnij Vardakas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Clash Royal have the most worst mechanics, first its very unbalanced playing 80 games in a row level 10's are over powered. This game also takes effect on mental health I think I broke 6 knives in my wall with that game. Very unfair system. Then they expect you to spend money cuz everyone else can listen buddy jobs are hard to get. And this game requires too much gold for upgrade. And this game requires less gems in chest so thats gay. I hope Supercell gets shutdown forever their games suck. Its a pay to win, not a game for people to enjoy. Did I mention it takes a toll of wanting to cause suicide or murder thoughts. Very bad for health. I am mentally ILL so I cant change what my feelings are but this game almost made me kill alot of real people. Super unbalanced very unfair, not fun its a pay to win. Please change the game or give me the rights and Ill make it better."

But Fortnite and Overwatch have proved that you can still make massive amounts of microtransaction money with a FAIR game. Supercell just doesn't care, all these reviews are wasting their time."
Mohammadreza Hashemi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It is the most unfair, nerve-racking, wasteful game that there ever is. It is not actually a game where two or more people interact. It is just a scam.

Nigel Denning,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"It's incongruous to say that Supercell have bad customer support when they have ZERO customer support.  There is no way to contact them, and even their semi-official channels like their Facebook page are ignored. Bugs reported thousands of times are as much a running joke among the playing community as they continue to persist after three,or even four years of continual irritation. The feelings of the unofficial user community (they're too idle and disinterested to have an official one) are completely ignored.  The million+ ignored calls for functionality (task force searches, clear out dead TF's etc) continue to weigh on the game and have caused dozens of forums to crop up to try and circumvent Supercell's inaction.  Their games are good, though getting tired now as they all rely on the same formula.  But I've yet to hear anyone praise them beyond their own staff in their self-aggrandising video releases. If I could score them zero, I would."

As a level 10 player, am I suppose to be facing people who are many more levels higher than myself? Maybe you should force it so you only play people who are your tower level, but maybe you’ll lose money and because you’re greedy you’ll ruin your game and no one will play it. Up to you, it’s very addicting, yet I can see your broken problems clear as day.

Kaw Councilofsouth,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Would give less but won’t allow.  Thief’s, hacks, cheats, and liars.  No the games aren’t rigged for one person or the other. They are rigged to make a player(s) lose to spend. It doesn’t care who as long as someone will eventually spend cash on the game.  Outrageous odds and complete unrealistic matchups make this game or any of supercell games a fail.  Prey on youth.  So pay attention"
Flow,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Clash Royale player here. Supercell is a company that tries to force its players into a P2W strategy that is superficially disguised as F2P. Regardless of any purchases made in game, the matchmaking itself is rigged to the core. Win streaks on your part are inevitably countered with loss streaks programmed by the game's algorithm, making for a despicable exploitation of consumers' time and money. I feel deeply sorry for any player that has invested any amount of money into Supercell's products, as the company essentially commits legal theft, leaving you without any in-game advantage whatsoever. This might potentially be excusable if Supercell were to admit to rigging and manipulating their games; However, as the company refuses to do so and continues to masquerade as an honest game developer, there can be no justification for their actions. I can only hope that their elaborate hoax will soon be uncovered."

Lastly they like to ingore there players and do what they plz . Do not play anything they offer unless you like to pay out the butt to win.
pappy lewis,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I share the pain of many others who have tried to get their village back. Apple support reset all my settings trying to fix a problem with my iPad and this led to me losing my village - despite being connected to supercell ID. I am still battling with the support desk to try to get it back. Latest advice was for me to contact them from within the game - as I cant get into my village I have no chance of doing that. I have answered so many questions and provided evidence of purchases to prove it's my account to no avail. So unhelpful and frustratingUPDATE - Supercell pulled out the stops and after weeks of to and fro'ing I now have my village back 😃 score updated to reflect the help I got....my advice is to persist and they will help you

But nope, they full on lock ( basically ban ) my account and I've tried for days with these crap support agents and it looks now I'm gonna be banned forever bc I cant find the exact receipt from that exact account from 6 years ago! Service was so bad and I lost my progress of a decent th11 and my earned money I had spent! Absolutely bull crap! They basically stole my money! Unbelievable."

Angela Handel,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Love the game had it for years. Never gave out any of my info and my account has been hacked while supercell just blocks my account and has said little to fix the problem or to know how this even happened.
Strategic Hacker,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I play Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, Brawlers. Very very bad customer support especially in the Brawlers.I reported the bug. It basically tell me I am idle after I clicked the play again button in the soccer match. It doesn't bother me that much because it happened only about once per month. They want me to send a video of that. How the hell do I show the proof since it is not like there is a replay button unless I always record whenever I play games! It made me unhappy because play again is very useful when you just met the other players that you click with. They told me about using VPN and stuffs would happen. I told them I don't use VPN, and my internet connection is always at least 100Mbps down and 5Mbps upload on any device since I am the only user in my house.This next issue totally made me write review in here. I reported the player who intentionally scored against his own team like own goal twice which makes us lose the game. That teammate teamed up with other team player. I have a replay. I told the customer support how can I send a replay so that they can ban that player account. They just reply me template about AFK and how they use bot in case the player got disconnected. I explained them again that I know what AFK and bot is, and I am not reporting about that and I am reporting separate issue. I also told them that they should read my messages carefully before scanning the message and reply me with template. Another agent replied and this time, it is worst. He said they have already reply reasonable answer, and thus, they won't be replying me anymore even I contact them again. Very disgraceful. I mean does Supercell create the bot that score his own goal twice?I have spent more than $500 in Supercell. This is how they treat the premium customer. Human Resource should give penalty or fire those 2 customer support agents(Nick Fa and Sparky). I am more mad to these 2 agents than the actual player, JORGE RAMOS)"

I am still hoping for the updates again soon regarding the farm expansion, decorations, etc. Thank you Supercell!!!"
Paula,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I’ve played clash of clans for five years now. I’ve probably spent over £200 on the game. Just the odd couple of pounds here and there but it adds up. But as you move up the levels it gets to a point where you are put in far too higher level and you and your defence against attackers loses every time and you do not swap sonny to levels you can play well in at least some of the timed . You become disheartened and give up. Also the customer service is shocking. Surely robots answer game players queries because their responses continually don’t make sense. I strongly suspect their customer service reps, have to be auto reply robots. I requested for weeks an explanation as to why I wasn’t getting all of my win stars in successful battles...useless non sensical replies came back....I gave up. Weeks later I realised I was reaching my daily limit. Would it have been so terribly hard to explain that to a customer. Apparently yes."
Duck C,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I’ve played Clash of Clans for four years now. I have multiple accounts with one of those being max. The game is complete trash at TH11-12. Gameplay isn't fair at TH12 for most players. I experience bad programming from supercell on most of my troop directions and heroes. I’ve recently had level 2 infernos on a rushed base take down a max army and max queen walk. Unfortunately these problems have never been fixed and doesn’t look to be fixed any time soon. After almost five years playing the game I’m ready to call it quits due to bad programming at TH11-12.
Gina Won,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"No doubt the company developed decent games; Clash of Clan; Clash Royale etc. However it's the customer service and the development team's lack of effort to balance the fairness of matches cause the anger of most of players. I personally spent many money and have been really good player enjoyed many good moment on this game. (Was top 200 in my local)  However; the direction of the game (adding more contents to lure players to spend more money for additional features) is not what can make most of people happy. I believe many users are still willing to see the balance of matches better, also hoping to see Supercell can improve customer service and player experience, It will definitely make the game more enjoyable. Unfortunately Supercell has already completely lost many players' respect and trust. I doubt supercell's game will still propel in 10 years later if they do not take customer review seriously. Overall, i've had good time enjoying the game until recently, it became fully a bad experiences for all $500 + USD I spent on this games over last 3 years."
NigelK,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Rigged matches and definitely pay to win. The game’s algorithm finds other players with cards that you’ve historically lost to a significant amount of time and pairs you with them so you can’t progress. Stupid rigged draft challenges that forces you to cough up money after you lose. Supercell? More like supershit.
Michael Sterling,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Good job at creating rigged games specifically meant to anger people and force them to pay in order to win. Clash Royale is a total piece of trash game.

They asked three questions, and he replied and then the next day he got banned. There are no replies from e-mail contacts and so he can do nothing. I tried to help via my app, and they keep saying as if I’m phishing his account and they are not providing enough information so he can find his account. I already have an account, which is linked to the gamecenter and supercell. Absurd, pathetic, and totally the worst service quality ever. Despite the good games, I just don’t want to play it anymore.. So disappointing."

Kirk,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If I could give a zero I would, SCAM do not give money or pay. GAME IS RIGGED elixir slows down the more games you win, you have to purchase in order to speed elixir. Many of your opponents are fake your playing against the app designed for you not to win, this way you go and buy better players and faster elixir to win more games. No doubt a fun game but dont fall trap to paying 1.99 or 5.99 thinking it's going to get you better, I get it its entertainment but at what point did app designers start rigging things to make you keep buying more to the point where it's obvious that its setup for you to lose before you even began to play. SAD could be fun if it wasn't rigged"

Everything is overpriced so if you don’t have money well too bad. Matchmaking is also broken why am I playing level 13 with max out decks as a level 10 with not even a single card over level 11? It’s not even like a once in every 10 games it’s more like once in ever 10 games i don’t play a level 13. Worst game company ever even makes EA look like a great company and that’s saying a lot.

Rosa on the other hand just can’t be killed and I might delete the game.

My favorite Brawler is Penny I’ve got every skin for her she amazing and I love her.

Their algorithm goes like this, you buy stuff in game you will win some games, for a short period then it's back to playing against much more difficult players that are Impossible to beat. Impossible, well that is u less you pocket out another load of cash. Worst company ever, probably why they hide in Finland. This company needs to be sued to 6 feet deep under. They need to leave this planet. This isn't how Americans do business. Corrupt company. You will not win with their customer service. That is what they are trained to do.

Bradley Cooper,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell cheats players out of their purchases. Here’s how. Opponents are allowed to capture resources (credits) when attacking, right? That’s the premise of the game. But when you buy resource credits via the discount offers, your purchased credits are commingled with your raid credits in the same storage location. This causes your purchased credits to become vulnerable. The problem is is that my purchased credits are unprotected. The discounted credits I received when buying from Supercell’s in game advertisements are effectively repossessed with every subsequent opponent attack. Additionally, My attacks go unrewarded because my storage accounts are full. Think about this for a minute. I attack you, I win credits (resources) from you, Supercell debits your storage accounts, Supercell keeps your credits because my storage accounts are full. Supercell’s response: Read item 2.3 of the TERMS OF SERVICE. In short, Supercell customer service confirmed that I have no right or title claim to any virtual items purchased. Spend your money wisely. Their accounting practices are suspect and thus vulnerable to class action."
Katherine Rose,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I am ashamed to say that I used to spend quite a bit of time and money on Clash Royale, one of Supercell's mobile games. I have been a loyal player for over a year now with no complaints. Until, two days ago. My husband and I were discussing a trade agreement in the game and after completing the trade, we experienced a bug in the game, in which my account was not credited the appropriate amount of items that I had used a token for. For those who are more curious about the specifics, I did not receive the 10 Executioners that my Clan Leader, aka my husband, had traded to me in exchange for 10 Hunters. I am out of one Epic token as well as 10 Executioners and my husband is minus the 10 executioners...so... they're somewhere, just not in either of our accounts. This would seem like a small issue and one that, frankly I figured Supercell would just rectify. Instead I have spent the past 2 days going back and forth with one of their customer service representatives, Serzio, and he has been unwilling to resolve the situation. He closed our conversation and I was not even able to ask to speak with a manager. I sent another message to support and Alex pleasantly offered his assistance. I had to re-explain what happened and he said that everything was correct on their end and I must have remembered it wrong. I wasn't the only one to see that my number of Executioners didn't increase. My husband was looking at it with me. Because of this experience, I will be uninstalling all Supercell games on all our devices and no longer contributing to their business. I suggest everyone else do the same because this company does not care to make things right when they have done wrong. Thanks for reading and happy gaming! Just not with Supercell."

Mohamed Wagdi,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I have had a village for about 4 years now, and when I tried to transfer it from my Samsung tablet, because it was old and it sucked, so I wanted to swap it to my IOS device, I gave them all the info, even the device name(The Samsung one) but I was missing the date the village was made, tell me who has a right mind to give two dams about remembering the date, then the permanently banned my IOS device account the I was using for the time to raplace it.It said that I was banned for account phishing although I had the account I tried to convert to my device in front of me.These people don’t care about their customers, they basically stole 25$ from me, the day after I bought the gems, I got banned, idk if I can sue them, but if I can that’s sweet."
Garret,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ATROCIOUS!!!!I have had an issue with my shop for a week and a half. After multiple support tickets I am now being ignored it seems...
Linda M,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"In April and May, I got a log of the diamonds I spent and I noticed there were 38 diamonds that I NEVER confirmed. I have diamond confirmation on and I do spend diamonds, but these LOST diamonds were never confirmed by me. I have emailed Supercell since May only to get a canned answer or they would ignore me. There were answers from Sofia, Michael, Spiros just to mention a few. They will respond one time and then ignore you and this was confirmed (lol) via the Supercell forums. How does a company with any integrity do that... well the answer is simple, Supercell has ZERO integrity and they steal. Those little diamonds are so precious, that even they want to take them! I have decided to delete the game from both my devices. I so angry at 'support' and I left my hood and let them all know why... they are hoping I get my diamonds back so I can come back to play. I'm a high level player and I won't allow a company to steal from me."
Jon “Jonwell”,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have been playing Clash Royale for 2 years now and I am disappointed because I basically know the patterns and schemes on how the matchmaking works for each player every time you play a game and you are going to lose the other player always uses emojis on you basically calling you a crybaby. And then when you paly another game and you are winning the other player never responds or sees your emojis because it's turned off because the Clash Royale server has always match you with another person that cannot see your emojis simple stuff like that it really ticks me off. It's so obvious each game is rigged!
MokeSavvy Mike,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I understand their games have a pay-to-win structure but even if you do pay, they're going to do a later ""balance"" that will make all your invested elixir/gold/gems completely worthless. Don't get me started on the abysmal matchmaking system in Royale.I won't be spending another dime on supercell products. They're q ckomplete joke."
A-Stacy Ward,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Since supercell didn't send me the link that I tried too many times am deleting the game. I spent at least $15 a week on diamonds because I played with 2 of my facebook account now you won't get any more money from me. I got locked out for trying too many times for which they never sent me the 6 digit code so good luck with fixing that am not participating any longer.
Joe,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Supercell Customer Support deletes tickets without responding.  They even delete tickets that ask where the previous ticket went (without responding).  The rare occasion that Supercell responds, it is clear that they have not read the ticket."
Leonel Espinoza,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Straight up trash company with trash games preying on the dumb people dumb enough to pay them money
Ral,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Greedy and unethical thieves. Rigged gameplay to extract maximum cash from players. They even take money for nothing are refuse to refund. Just read their appalling terms of service. Can't believe they are even legal. Their customer service is a disgrace with arrogant responses and they just delete all messages if challenged. Simply the worst kind of business model imaginable.
Fayke Wan2,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They constantly change game play.Support sux.One is almost sure what Supercell will do based on how many players they can p**s off in one motion it seems. Too obvious that this company has no idea how to support their players. Patronizing unprofessional behavior.
Jonathan Faulkner,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bad company that DON'T FOLLOW THERE OWN RULES ... Clash Royale Team are very Guilty of This as they don't follow there own policy of fair play when you push the issues they banned you from the game they a bunch of babies driven by there own self greed in the game.  They defend dirty play in the game and alter information on the cards which can be seen as nothing but CHEATING regardless if they call it balancing that they said they go on feedback from the players of the game I have seen NO prefer of this so I suggest is nothing more than a Lie on there part .  There Hallmark of Fair play is a joke they don't know the difference from fair play and dirty play. The Team Clash Royale have a Fetish for Facial hair as its mentioned on at least 6 or 7 Cards in the game ...PLAYERS ARE NOT BOTHERED WITH FACIAL HAIR as players don't have a fetish for it . THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PLAYERS OF THE GAME AT ALL they rigg all the battles and the Wars and a team of greedy low life scum
Janet Long,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Spoke to a helpful goblin yes goblin to recover one of my 4 clash ofClans bases .Spent 2 months proving it was my bases helpful goblin had a Different name every time I spoke to it.Already have a base on game centre so couldn’t recover that way.They said they could do an overwrite but because my son had an overwrite when his iPad died last year they could not do it again.Unfortunately we have all bases on same Apple ID.So more of Tolkien goblin than a helpful one .
Ashley Pinnock,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,i see a lot of people moaning about how there attacks suck because they don't make online purchases i don't make online purchases but my attacks are still solid its the way you drop your troops not the company trying to make you buy more
Abdelah ns,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They don't care about players nor fanbase. all they is make a pay to win game after another. and higher the prices to a really unfair amount. they ask for too much for too little. Supercell is an example on how disgusting greed is.
Carlos Miranda,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is Los supercell and I don't plan on giving up on recovering my lost village of 3 years plus just so you know, even if I have to write a horrible review about the game which would be hard for me to do because I Love Clash of Clans so much and is an awesome game...   I have lost this village 3 times counting this last time. I won't write full details but to keep it short here it goes so everyone else can see what a great team you guys had in the past but and what your team of expert's have come to being...The first two times I lost it your team gave me a head ache but we're able to retrieve my lost village with all the information I was able to remember because I did not and still do not have access to any receipts from my gem purcheses or any of that information, and even like that your great team helped out this person in despair...   This time I requested to speak to a real worker and not an automated computer with steps to follow... I could have followed those steps provided if I were able to but cannot because that information belongs to my stepdad which passed away and my phone was in his name with Verizon.... At first your team was respectfully meeting my request by speaking with a real worker but after that first contact with a supercell agent they switched workers and thus having to resend information I had sent the first worker. So I resent my information to the second worker with any information previously missed and yet I got another worker asking me once more for the information I had already sent the first and second worker so for the last time I ended up sending the third worker my information and yet I still keep getting different workers replying what I wrote the previous worker and the messages started looking automated AND I TAKE THAT AS A HUGE DISRESPECT by sneaking a computer back to assist me when I specifically requested a live agent and not a whole team of differently named agents which can't do the job right and read the information I sent to all the other workers forcing me to rewrite everything time and time again.....I started a new village to try and load my current village on this phone and my lost village on that phone but supercell wont let me write them and have been blocked out for some reason with this phone. That's why I'm writing this on the review page because I feel very poor support from your team of 'experts'... Please help me like both times I was unable to retrieve those receipts and recovered my village Los successfully....It's impossible to have alllllll the information accurate if I were not the original owner..... knowing people from ALL around the world play that game, and how huge a single country can be to guess a town hall level with the correct name, where it was created, time and almost exact date of my last playing session, what phone was used to creat it and every other question asked about it has been correct and I still don't see why or how you gave it back twice but now I just keep getting the run around and I feel like I'm being played with by workers whom can't take their job serious enough to work on a case with out just showing up to work and press a few send buttons of automated messages...Im absolutely positive this review I'm writing has a huge turned around good ending to it but I cannot at the moment say your team of expert's are really commited until I see commitment fulfilled... sorry for the trouble and sorry about this review but I have clan members in need of my 4 years of experience playing this clash of clans game and could use the support of my Lost village along with the mini  los I started in January while Los was lost... thank you For all your help and or concerns.. LOS"
Jay Johnson,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Fraudulent extortion, supercell are focused by complete greed. Not only do they want to charge you for everything second by second but they also scrutinise how much loot can be won and how your attacks and defenses perform match to match depending on your purchases and/or your oppositions purchases. The game is quite addictive for a cell phone game... but thats just it... its a cell phone game, with little depth, very limited scope, in that everyone at the same th level has the same units and c'mon look at it. Ive seen chidrens paintings with more style/detail. DONT GIVE GREEDY SUPERCELL A PENNY!"
Joshua Criddle,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Terrible, I play COC, but you cannot do well or get anywhere without playing tons of tons of money. They are con artist, because even if you pay for a few gems, if you stop paying, your attacks magically start to suck over and over, and you never get anywhere."
Madness,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Super-cell changed they are not as greedy as they use to be...they update pruddy oftenthey are kindand a long time ago they gave away a free mag chest were i got alegendry from (plz do dat agian :D)so I think they change however, they are slowly updating slower though"
Fred Habeeb,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,There the worst people in the world id talk to isis before i talked to them
Bella Ryan ,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would advise parents to keep their children as far away from Supercell games as far as  possible.Their games are designed to draw the user in and through various sales and incentives get you to part with vast sums of money. My son asked me to buy him one game out of his pocket money I have ended up with a bill of over £200 not realising my credit card details were stored and despite sending numerous emails asking supercell for a refund I have been ignored . Am appalled at their customer service for parents and how addictive this game is for young children.
Mustafa,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Games sick but they are more after ur miney than anything. What really takes the pisss is clash royale when u upgrade a card u will go on at least a 10 losing streak or when u lose one game u lose the lot till u come of. It needs to sort that losing streak out. Its predictable. However the clan battle was a grwat idea. Rate then on that. I do hate the crown chest because its far to long. Our clan just about manages 10/10 within the last few hours and we are very active with 50 members. However we do the clan chest within a day. So supercell please change this and keep up the great new ideas. But stop with the deals. U make billions anyway. Whats a few quid gonna do. I was on 4000 and somethibg triphies playing a level 8 with all max cards. Please sort that out. Again with the ideas like dragt challenege and free tourneys. Keep it up. Great game. And clas pf clans. Again great game but u get like town hall 11 with nearly everything maxed on 1200 trophies. Im town hall 9 with nearly everything max for th9 and i admit i drop trophies so i cant get 3 starred but could u somehow split it up a bit so town hall 11s with max pekkas and stuff cant attack people with level 5 cannon thanks.

Dan Callaghan,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I would advise parents to keep their children as far away from Supercell games as possible.Their games are designed to draw the user in and through various sales and incentives get you to part with vast sums of money.For the amount of money it would cost to buy an Xbox One Console, a PS4 Console, a Nintendo Switch. (roughly £$1000) You can upgrade your walls about 2 levels. Forget the other 100 or so buildings.According to the Clash of Clans wiki the total cost of upgrading everything is 1,688,882 gems which works out to be $12,068.77. Now that is assuming you have 2,860d 5h 7m to spare because the cost estimate is for build only and does not take into account speeding any of the build times up. So to upgrade everything you are looking at roughly $25,000To make this task even more impossible they are constantly adding levels.For a game that is making such vast amounts of money, you would expect tons of fresh content, new troops, new buildings, great offers, but nothing.All this company cares about is milking as much money from the player as possible.The game itself get's very repetitive, clan wars are always mismatched with much higher level players in the opposing clans, so you clan will win 1 out of 20 wars on average.It's almost impossible to have active players, as so many start and see through the con very quickly and leave.Clash Royale is no better, and in Clash Royale is the players with money who win all the time, and like Clash of Clans in order to be competitive you will need very deep pockets.Boom Beach ditto...In short please avoid these games, get yourself a console which is much better value for money."
Iain,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Thankfully, there isn't many companies like Supercell in existence right now. They used to be independent and built games to last, with a small focus on supporting the game with upsell purchases.They are now owned by an investment company and the real focus now is profits and share prices.If you are a parent or guardian, I wholly advise not to allow your children to download these games as they use very clever tactics to engage and encourage ongoing purchases.It is very easy to spend hundreds of pounds on these games."

Malcolm,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,On the whole these are good games the only draw back is you have to keep buying diamonds (their currency) although they do state play for free which is what I am trying to do but it will take a lifetime.
